<span style="font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif; color:#444; font-size:14px; line-height:19px;">Back pain, either chronic or intermittent, negatively impacts the daily life of many patients.  The degree and severity varies from patient to patient; however, one constant is the search for both relief and cause of the pain.  Often overlooked in this search are the sleeping arrangements of the patient, specifically the patientâ€™s mattress.  Due to both the cost of mattresses and its impact on back pain, a patient should be aware of how best to maximize comfort and back support.<br />
<br />


Over the past few years, twelve published studies explored this very topic.  These studies vary from patients with chronic back pain to hospitalized patients.  Though personal preference may influence decisions on mattress quality, these studies concluded that a medium-firm mattress provides better outcomes than hard-firm mattresses (Kovacs et. al 2003a).  Medium-firm mattresses were found to provide the necessary back support without exacerbating pressure points in both the shoulder and hip areas, allowing the hips and shoulders to sink slightly into the mattress.<br />
<br />
An adjustable mattress such as the Sleep Number bed can be an excellent choice for those with back problems. These beds allow one to adjust the firmness of the mattress. In addition, the opposite half of the bed can be adjusted to the preference of the person's bed mate; who may or may not have issues with their backs. Often times, what is comfortable in the store will no longer be comfortable after several nights at home. These mattresses give the user the flexibility to adjust in the future as preferences or needs dictate.<br />
<br />


Another issue to consider with back pain and mattresses is the age of the mattress.  Years of daily use ages the mattress to the point where the mattress may cave into the middle.  Any mattress displaying signs of caving, especially older mattresses, do not offer the appropriate support for the spine.
<br />
<br />
So when considering shopping for a new mattress, patients should find a balance between back support and comfort (Sellers, 2012).</span></td>

<span style="font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif; color:#444; font-size:14px; line-height:19px;">As many as three in four women may experience back pain during pregnancy. There are a few different reasons why you may have back pain throughout the nine months. Below is a list of causes,  treatments, and how to deal with back pain during your pregnancy.<br />

    </table><strong>Weight gain-</strong> The extra weight of the baby weakens your abdominal muscles, changing your posture and putting strain on your back. This extra weight you're carrying means more work for your muscles and increased stress on your joints, which is why your back may feel worse at the end of the day.<br />
<br />


<strong>Posture changes-</strong>Your expanding uterus shifts your center of gravity. You may begin to gradually adjust your posture and the way you move. This increases the work load of your back. <br />
<br />


<strong>Hormonal changes- </strong>Your hormones in pregnancy loosen your joints and the ligaments that attach your pelvic bones to your spine. This can make you feel less stable and cause pain when you walk, stand, sit for long periods, roll over in bed, get out of a low chair or  tub, bend, or lift things.<br />
<br />


<strong>Stress-</strong> Emotional stress can cause muscle tension in the back and this may be felt as pain or spasms. You may experience increased back pain during stressful periods of your pregnancy. <br />
<br />

 

Luckily there are many things you can do to treat low back pain in pregnancy. Trying to refrain from any oral medications is best, as most medications do cross the placenta barrier and can effect you baby. You should always check with your OB Doctor prior to taking such medications. Here is a list of a few things you can do to treat your back pain conservatively.
<br />
<br />

 

<strong>Exercise-</strong> Regular exercise strengthens muscles and boosts flexibility. This can ease the stress on your spine. Safe exercises for most pregnant women include walking, swimming, and stationary cycling. <br />

<br />

<strong>Hot and Cold Therapies-</strong> Applying hot and cold therapies to your back may help. You may alternate ice and heat as you wish. You can apply ice bags or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel to your back. Heating pads are also ok, but be careful not to apply heat to your abdomen during pregnancy. <br />
<br />

<strong>Improve your posture- </strong>Proper posture when working, sitting, or sleeping reduces the strain on your back. Stand up straight and tall and hold your chest high, while keeping your shoulders back and relaxed. Sleeping on your side with a pillow between the knees will take stress off your back. When sitting at a desk, place a rolled-up towel behind your back for support; rest your feet on a stack of books or stool and sit up straight, with your shoulders back. <br />
<br />


<strong>Clothing- </strong>Wear low heeled shoes with good arch support. Be sure to wear maternity pants with a low supportive waist band. A maternity lumbar support belt may help by taking the pressure off your spine. You can ask your OBGYN where to purchase these.<br />
<br />


 

Most often the pain appears in the later months or becomes worse as pregnancy progresses. It may also persist after the baby arrives, but postpartum back pain usually resolves in a few months. The good news is that there's no link between back pain and pregnancy outcome.</span></td>

<span style="font-size:13px; font-style:italic;color:#001f42;">&#8212; by Dr. Kevin P. McCarthy</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif; color:#444; font-size:14px; line-height:19px;">The facet joints of the lumbar spine are responsible for controlling motion and providing stability to the lower back. These small articulations can develop arthritis and inflammation similar to the hip, knee and other larger joints in the body. The facets are thought to be responsible for low back pain in up to 40% of cases.<br />
<br />

    </table>
The facet joints are innervated by a small medial branch of the spinal nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmitting the sensation of pain from the facet back to the brain. In patients with suspected facet related pain, the medial branch has historically been targeted with a rhizotomy. This procedure has been classically done by pain management doctors. A probe is inserted percutaneously with X-ray guidance to the area where the nerve is thought to be located based on anatomic relationships. The probe is then heated and wanded back and forth with the hope of ablating the nerve and relieving the pain. However, this blind technique can have its limitations and failures, and recurrence rates can be high. When this procedure is successful, patients can experience relief of their lower back pain up to 12-18 months.<br />
<br />


The Spine Center at the Bone and Joint Clinic of Baton Rouge has been performing a new and innovative procedure for facet related back pain. Patients are diagnosed with this condition through a physical examination, radiographic studies and a confirmatory medial branch block injection. Appropriate patients are considered for the endoscopically assisted medial branch rhizotomy. <br />
<br />


During this procedure, an endoscope is inserted percutaneously and the medial branch nerve is located with direct visualization. The endoscope has a unique working channel through which special instruments such as a laser or radiofrequency probe can be inserted. Using these instruments, the medial branch nerve can then be ablated under direct visualization. It is theorized that this procedure will allow more accurate targeting of this nerve and thus more predictable and lasting results than the more common blind medial branch rhizotomy. This procedure has been performed with great success at the Bone and Joint Clinic since 2009. The Spine Center is currently enrolling patients in a clinical study to collect comparative data on the effectiveness of this new technique.
