</table>Scoliosis is defined as a curvature of the spine. It is diagnosed on x-ray when a curvature of 10 degrees or more is identified. Most scoliosis is idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. Despite extensive research, the etiology remains unclear, but the role of genetic factors has been widely documented. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis presents from age 10 through 17 years and affects females more often. The greater the curve and the younger the patient, the greater the risk of progression. For this reason, it is very important that all children undergo scoliosis screening starting at an early age. <br />
<br />

The basic method for screening scoliosis is the Adams forward bending test. School screening programs for adolescent scoliosis are mandated in 26 states in the US. The Adams Forward bend test is performed by having the patient bend forward from the waist with the spine parallel to the floor with feet together, knees straight, and arms hanging down. The health care professional should be behind the patient looking for a curvature or rotation of the spine. <br />
<br />


<img src="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1112/images/scoliometer.jpg"  style="float:right; margin:5px 0 15px 15px;" />If a school nurse or yourself suspects that your child might have scoliosis, you should seek specialized treatment from an orthopedic spine surgeon. Treatment is based on the age of the patient and the degree of curvature measured on a standing scoliosis x-ray. In some cases, an MRI may be warranted to look at the spinal cord. Small curvatures less than 20 degrees may be managed by monitoring the curvature with serial x-rays every 3-12 months. Bracing is indicated for curves measuring 20-40 degrees in patients with significant growth remaining. Surgical intervention should be considered in skeletally immature patients with failed brace treatment and curves greater than 40 degrees. Mature patients with curves greater than 50 degrees may also be considered. The goal of surgery is to obtain adequate correction of the deformity while maintaining balance of the trunk. The prognosis for Scoliosis can be very good if caught early. This is why we encourage scoliosis screening beginning at age 9, either by a school nurse or pediatrician.

Osteoporosis has affected 44 million Americans. Fifty percent of those are over the age of 55 and eighty percent are female. Normal bone health and strength is typically maintained by the body between ages two and 30 with a peak bone mass occurring during the end of the third decade. There is an overall decrease in the amount of normal bone in osteoporosis. The World Health Organization has defined it as 2.5 standard deviation below average bone density of that of a healthy 25 year old of the same sex. <br />
<br />

There are over 150,000 hospital admissions per year and 161,000 office visits per year due to osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The direct U.S. cost exceeds 13.8 billion dollars per year. As our population ages by the year 2020 the U.S. population will be 30% over the people over age 65. By 2030 the cost is expected to exceed $60 billion per year. <br />
<br />

Osteoporosis has been associated with primarily genetic predispositions with abnormal genes related to problems with Vitamin D and collagen. Routine screening with a DEXA scan typically diagnoses most patients who are either osteopenic (abnormal bone but not as bad as osteoporosis) or osteoporotic. Patient risk factors include: increasing age, female sex, post-menopausal or early menopause, fair-skinned, maternal/paternal history of hip fractures, low body weight, cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol use, low protein intake, and certain anti-seizure or anti-depressant medications. The most common locations for broken bones are the vertebrae (spine), hip, and wrist. <br />

Osteoporotic fractures clinically often appear with an antecedent event where a patient complains of pain that develops acutely after an activity, or from prior injury. The patient also may exhibit myelopathic symptoms such as spinal cord compression. A red flag in this patient population is if they present with constitutional symptoms; then, one should consider malignancy as a differential diagnosis, where A complete review of systems should be carried out. The physical examination should involve evaluation of the patient’s posture. They often have hyperkyphosis. They may exhibit posterior tenderness, which is indicative of an acute injury and a thorough neurologic evaluation with reflexes should be performed. Consideration in your medical evaluation should be directed to the cardiopulmonary compromise that these patients exhibit secondary to severe hyperkyphosis. In fact, a single vertebral compression fracture increases mortality by 23-34% and it has also been seen that a single vertebral compression fracture can cause 9% of loss of respiratory functional vital capacity. The degree of kyphosis is significantly related to the risk of death from pulmonary compromise. Radiographic evaluation of these patients begins with plain radiographs. MRIs are often sought to rule out other pathologic causes in particular malignancies. CT scans can be used to evaluate canal compromise. The Morphology of vertebral compression fractures include three different types. Biconcave, being the first of the three, is the failure of the endplate. Wedge indicates the failure of just the anterior column, and Crush is the failure of the anterior and middle columns.<br />
<br />

Treatment typically involves nonoperative measures such as activity modification, bracing, and medications for pain control. Surgical indications in osteoporotic spine fractures are subacute and acute pain management, progressive deformity, progressive neurologic deficits and also findings that may present late. These include continuing deformity, intractable pain and neurogenic claudication. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are measures that treat subacute and acute pain and provide some fracture stabilization. Cement is often used as an adjuvant. In vertebroplasty, high pressure injection of cement is injected into the vertebral body which goes to provide some structural stability and stop further deformity. It has been reported to control pain up to 90%. However, it does not reduce fractures and is unable to restore vertebral height; whereas, kyphoplasty can restore height with balloon assistance then maintain it with cement injection. Surgery of the osteoporotic spine often uses combined approaches. The advantages are that you can achieve circumferential stability. It is an efficient way to correct sagittal plane deformity while decreasing instrument failure. Circumferential stability also increases the fusion rate. The disadvantage in this patient population is the surgical morbidity. Combined approaches may be used in variations like the anterior/posterior approach combined with vertebral cement augmentation. Cement augmentation of screw fixation provides for an increase pullout resistance. 2 cc’s of cement increases pullout by 500% while 3 cc’s increases it by 600%. There is an exothermic reaction that is created by cement; however, this may lead to loosening at the bone cement interface. If there are angular deformities, closing or opening Wedge osteotomies can also be added to correct alignment. In conclusion, osteoporosis is increasingly common and new technological advances in fixation and design will help increase bone strength and overall treatment.
