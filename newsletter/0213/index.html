In today's world of hustle and bustle, neck injury and pain are common complaints. One way in which injury to the neck can occur, is through a phenomenon commonly known as "whiplash." We all know the typical scenario in which a person is struck from behind while sitting in a vehicle. Sometimes that person suffers a significant enough injury and needs to be rushed to the hospital. The patient is stabilized, treated and follow-up care is initiated. However, what if it was a minor accident? Patients often wonder if they should seek medical treatment even if they feel "okay" after what is deemed a small accident. When should you be worried? Before we answer that question, let's review the mechanics of whiplash and its effects on the human spine (Walker and Highsmith, 2012).<br />
<br />

"The term whiplash was originally used in 1928 to describe head and neck motion during a rear-impact motor vehicle crash causing soft tissue injury"(Sinkov and Tortolani, 2012, p. 273). However, it is now accepted that whiplash covers any indirect injury to the cervical spine.  This does not include fracture or dislocation. In addition to car accidents, whiplash can be related to sports injury, falls, being punched or shaken (Walker and Highsmith, 2012).  Whiplash is and acceleration-deceleration injury which can cause damage to the cervical spine.  Think about our car accident example. Your resting head and neck are flung into motion while you are sitting in your vehicle. Then your head and neck rapidly come to rest. The resulting motion can cause damage to the structures of your neck (Walker and Highsmith,2012).<br />
<br />

Persons that experience whiplash can have different levels of pain and have different symptoms. Whiplash can graded into five different categories and present differently.

In addition, it should be noted that only 37% of patients have pain immediately after the accident. However, 90% of patients develop symptoms within 24 hours (Sinkov and Tortolani, 2012).<br />
<br />

By seeking medical attention, you can be evaluated and treated in several ways. Depending on the severity and nature of your injury, this can include a variety of treatments. Evaluation will involve a thorough physical examination with imaging of your neck. Imaging may be in the form of X-Rays, CT scans, or an MRI. Treatments can include medications such as anti-inflammatories or muscle relaxers. Treatment may also involve physical therapy or home exercise programs. Damage to your neck can involve boney structures, muscles, nerves, discs or any combination of all of the above. In some of these instances spine surgery may be required. Your spine specialist will recommend the best procedure and treatment in regards to your individual circumstance. Whiplash patients may have such a variety and range of pain that treatments will need to be individualized (Sinkov and Tortolani, 2012).<br />
<br />

Getting back to our original question, "When should I be worried?" It should be noted that an 8 mph collision can cause a 5-G (five times normal gravity) deceleration of a person's head. Injury likely occurs around 6-G, with short term disability caused by 10-G (Sinkov and Tortolani, 2012). What this means is a low mile per hour accident is enough to injure and possibly disable a person for a short time. With this in mind, and the fact that many people (37%) don't experience immediate pain, you should be worried even after a low impact injury. Even if you do not feel that you need to seek treatment immediately, it is highly suggested you make an appointment to be evaluated by a healthcare specialist as soon as possible. As stated before, you will likely become symptomatic, as most people (90%) do, within 24 hours of the event. When symptoms begin to occur you will be happy you contacted your spine specialist (Walker and HighSmith, 2012).<br />

Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) is defined by pain management specialists as &quot;persistent back and leg pain after spine surgery.&quot;   FBSS has multiple etiologies including post-laminectomy syndrome, arachnoiditis and epidural fibrosis and others. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Service (CMMS) reports spending for inpatient back pain surgery increased over 100% over one decade. During that time, lumbar fusion rates increased over 500% in regards to spending.  Spinal cord stimulator use has also gone up 160%.  Of prime importance is determining which patients who have had back surgery previously are better candidates for spinal cord stimulation vs revision procedures vs observation. Indications include failed back surgery syndrome notably post-laminectomy syndrome, chronic regional pain syndrome, ischemic limb pain, angina and less common including brachial or cervical neuritis, post-spinal cord injury patients, post-herpetic neuralgia and neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.   Contraindications include pacemakers, the need for serial MRIs, patients on chronic anti-coagulation, any systemic infection and relative contraindications include patients that have failed a spinal cord stimulator trial, patients with psychiatric conditions and rapidly evolving pain patterns.<br />
<br />

	The idea of electric neuromodulation is not new to spinal cord stimulation. Electroneuromodulation has been used all over the body for a multitude of etiologies and diseases including occipital neuralgia, migraines, airway disorders, dysphagia, chest pain, bladder stimulators and pudendal nerve (overactive bladder) disorders.   A primary concept behind spinal cord stimulation is the masking or &quot;trading&quot; of pain with tingling sensations (paresthesias) or numbness. SCS is &quot;an adjustable neuromodulatory procedure for neuropathic pain via the direct electric spinal cord stimulation.&quot; The patients indicated for this have failed both surgical and medical options for pain control. The goal is to improve a patient's quality of life and function while decreasing their narcotics in a cost effective manner.<br />
<br />
  
	Spinal cord stimulators' true mechanism of action is still debated. The basic principle is that centers around the inhibition of pain transmission in the dorsal form to the ascending pathways.  It masks pain with paresthesias or numbness. Chemically â€“ inhibition of spinal cord dorsal horn cell release of substance B, serotonin, and GABA via multiple animal studies in primates, cats and rats is thought to occur.  Spinal cord stimulator works by modulating both ascending and descending cord pathways. The general idea is that electrical stimulation over the dorsal epidural space creates a complex electrical field which then affects different structures both at the segmental peripheral nerve fibers, the dorsal ascending columns and brain pathways. <br />
<br />
  
	Medicare defines use of SCS as a &quot;last resort.&quot; Medicare selection criteria include:   Multi-disciplinary evaluation include psychiatric screening should be performed, documented MRI etiology of a lumbosacral arachnoiditis (or pts with known nerve root injury) are good candidates, and patients should have a &quot;positive&quot; trial (which is prognostic), which is defined as a 3-8 day base screening in which temporarily percutaneous leads and a generator are used and then explanted with at least a 50% decrease in patient reported pain at both rest and activity.  An ideal candidate is a patient that has had maximum expected medical and/or surgical recovery from the initial or inciting problem/event therefore exhausting medical and surgical options, has had a positive successful trial, is free of any narcotics addiction, has passed psychological screening and has predominantly extremity over axial and distal over proximal pain.<br />
<br />

	The basic components of a spinal cord implanted stimulators including electrodes, a lead wire, extensions and a power source.  Surgery is performed percutaneously or via a standard laminectomy or laminotomy one level caudal to the target level.  Originally these devices were implanted in the subarachnoid space but since that time we have learned that the epidural space (less migration) is best for placement predominantly dorsally over laterally or ventrally.  You can see that you must then tunnel the lead wires to a pulse generator which is then implanted and it is typically implanted in the buttocks around the crest area greater than the abdomen greater than a subclavicular nature.<br />
<br />

	Complications in a recent systematic review showed 43% of patients treated with SCS for failed back surgery syndrome experience at least one complication. The predominant complications involve electrode or lead problems, cable breakage. CSF leak, infection and generator problems are also possible. Neurologic complications are exceedingly rare or not reported.  <br />
<br />

	The most important question for the future is: Are spinal cord stimulators cost effective?   Recent studies suggest they are.  In summary, chronic pain treatment is challenging. The goal of spinal cord stimulation is a 50% decrease in pain. Importance of selection criteria trialing and psychiatric tests cannot be underestimated. Technology has advanced the field over the past 30 years. New evidence shows SCS  may be cost effective over continued medical management for these patients.
