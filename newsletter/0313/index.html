<strong>What is a clinical research study?</strong> <br />
Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.  Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patients’ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physicians’ recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments. <br />
<br />

<strong>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</strong><br />
Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries. <br />
<br />

We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.   <br />
<br />

All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.<br />
<br />
<strong>What is required of a patient in a research study?</strong><br />
Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures. All of the Consent forms for our current studies can be found at <a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/clinical-research" target="_blank">www.spinecenterbr.com/clinical-research</a>. <br />
<br />

After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.  All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bottom Line: Why should I participate?</strong><br />
In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study. The study staff is an added resource; we are available to address any questions or concerns and coordinate all study activities. We carefully monitor research participants before and after surgery.

<strong>What's your core?</strong> <br />
The "core" is the central portion of the body consisting of the pelvic region and abdominal region 360 degrees around the body. This area is also known as the mid-section, from the lower rib cage to the middle of the thighs (abdominal area, lower back, and thoracic region of the spine. These areas serve to provide maximal support and stability to the rest of the body and are especially important in holding up the upper body in proper posture for everyday activities (1). <br />
<br />

<strong>Why your back hurts?</strong>	<br />
Weak core muscles can create several problems for the body, most commonly low back pain. Strengthening the core and creating more effective support to the spine can drastically reduce low back pain. Furthermore, the harmony of muscles that will result in a strong core will provide more stabilization which will then transfer more power from the legs to the upper body and vice versa (1). In 2001, a study was conducted with 148 participants who complained of 10 or more years of low back pain. The subjects underwent 3 months of therapy and core muscles toning and strengthening routines. As a result, all of the subjects experienced significant improvements in muscle activation in the core area in endurance, strength and pain tolerance (2).<br />
<br />
  
<strong>How to start?</strong>	<br />
Before learning how to adequately strengthen the core, it is important to understand that the muscles of this region are in many layers and run in many different directions. With this in mind, it will be easier to remember that simply doing abdominal crunches will not be sufficient in strengthening the core. The best way to approach core training is from an inside-out approach. This means targeting the deeper stabilizing muscles that surround the spine and torso first. Strengthening these muscles allow the other larger muscles of the body to work more efficiently and effectively. Doing exercises such as planks or hip extensions will target these stabilizers. The next step is to strengthen the core in a twisting and diagonal movement pattern. Exercises that target these movement patterns are pushing or pulling exercises that cross over the midline of the body.  Once the stabilizing, rotational, and diagonal core muscles are properly developed, it is then safer to target the abdominal and trunk loaded muscles. It is important to remember here that just because a person has graduated to this level of training, does not make it OK to abandon the lower levels (3). <br />
