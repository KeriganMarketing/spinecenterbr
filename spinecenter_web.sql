INSERT INTO `blogPosts` VALUES (3, ' C. Chambliss Harrod, MD', 'cchambliss@spinecenterbr.com', '<p>Some have suggested Low Back Pain (LBP) may perform a functional role as a protective agent by focusing women&rsquo;s attention on the physical stresses their bodies are undergoing by becoming more cautious during pregnancy. 19% of women with severe low back pain during pregnancy elect not to have another pregnancy due to their fear of low back pain recurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LBP reportedly results in sick leave from work in as many as 30% of pregnant woman, persists longer than 6 months in 6% of cases, and disturbs sleep in over one-third. A nine-month prevalence rate of approximately 50% has been widely quoted in the literature. The incidence of women who experience LBP during their pregnancy ranges from 24% to 90% for different population samples in both retrospective and prospective studies. Three common mechanisms have been proposed to cause/contribute to pregnancy-related LBP: Biomechanical/Musculoskeletal, hormones, and vascular (blood flow) related problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biomechanical/Musculoskeletal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classic hypothesis is that weight gain during pregnancy results in postural changes that produce pain including primarily anterior displacement of the center of gravity of the trunk and abdomen. Women unconsciously shift their head and upper body posteriorly over their pelvis, inducing hyperlordosis (increased swayback) of the lumbar spine. Shift in load distribution generates stress on intervertebral disks, facet joints, and ligaments. However, research has largely refuted this theory and researchers argue that LBP is not created by hyperlordosis induced by pregnancy, but instead that women with a large lumbar lordosis prepartum are more vulnerable to LBP during pregnancy. The short time frame in which one&rsquo;s weight increases may play a role (secondary) in the development of LBP. Women gain between 26.4 to 26.6 lbs, with the uterus expanding 150 times in size and contributing to half of the overall weight increase. The weight of the gravid uterus may also directly compress on the base of the pelvis and lumbosacral plexus, and cause pain radiation to the buttocks and legs. 25% of pregnant women with LBP changed their job compared to 3% in a control group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etiology-Hormonal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correlation of the onset of menstruation and menopause with LBP suggests a hormonal role as the hormones relaxin, estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol all demonstrate increased serum levels during pregnancy. Relaxin is the hormone most notably implicated in pregnancy-related LBP and current theory suggests that high levels of relaxin in the first trimester, which stimulates collagenase expression, may increase joint laxity and promote LBP while promoting expansion of the cervix and uterus. Estrogen is believed to enhance relaxin&rsquo;s effect on joints either by increasing relaxin receptor sensitivity or by directly influencing joints. While these changes may directly lead to pelvic instability, they accommodate for the fetus during pregnancy and delivery. It may act as a protective agent by reducing fracture risk due to a fall or other trauma during pregnancy. Despite these findings, an association between serum relaxin levels, joint laxity, and LBP during pregnancy remains unclear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etiology-Vascular:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gravid uterus can apply pressure on the aorta and vena cava, especially between L1 to L5. In addition, there is an average increase in water retention of up to 8.5 liters during pregnancy. Increased blood flow to pelvic organs, venous distensibility due to progesterone, and inadequate collateral venous circulation distal to the point of occlusion can exacerbate symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk Factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>94% of women who suffer from LBP during pregnancy will develop LBP in subsequent pregnancies. Women with any history of back pain are 50% more likely to experience LBP during pregnancy than women with no prior back pain and that pain will persist for a longer duration. The two most debated risk factors for LBP during pregnancy- age and parity (multiple pregnancies). Multiparous women were found to experience pain for a longer duration of time and developed back pain especially in the final trimester of pregnancy. Also, ethnicity, oral contraceptive use, educational level, low socioeconomic class, occupation, and vocational risks have also been identified as risk factors for LBP. In contrast, other factors such as maternal height, weight, and weight gain along with the baby&rsquo;s weight have been confirmed not to have an effect on LBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinical Presentation-History/Symptoms:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1/3 of all pregnant women describe severe LBP sometime during their pregnancy. Pregnant women also report similar times of pain onset and indicate the fifth and sixth months as time periods in which backache was most prevalent. Several studies also reported times of the day for worst pain-the evening hours seem to be the most troublesome. Approximately 67% of pregnant women suffer from night discomfort or backache and 36% have night backache so severe it wakes them from sleep. Prevalence of women with lumbar pain typically remains constant throughout pregnancy, whereas the prevalence of posterior pelvic pain increases during the middle and late stages of pregnancy. Between 45.5% and 65% of women report radiation of pain into the buttocks and as many as half report experiencing LBP with radiation down one leg and &lt; 25% down both legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinical Presentation-Physical Examination/Signs:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posterior pelvic pain presents differently than lumbar pain and tends to be acute, pregnancy-induced, and rare among non-pregnant patients. Pain-free periods are experienced and abatement generally occurs 3 months postpartum. Clinically, patients present with backache and a &ldquo;deep, boring, ill-defined pain that is poorly localized&rdquo; and radiates down the posterolateral thigh as far as the calf. It is theorized large innervation of the sacroiliac joint (L4-S1) contributes to the referred pain experienced by pregnant women. The term &ldquo;posterior pelvic pain&rdquo; intentionally adopted to emphasize its diffuse anatomic origin over the sacroiliac area. Also, while pregnancy did not affect the progression of scoliosis in untreated patients, these patients had a slightly increased risk of back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work-Up:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General rule: Avoid exposing fetus to any ionizing radiation. However, risks to developing fetus are small, and no type of physical or mental abnormality has been reported with fetal exposure &lt; 10 rads (dose of 3-part spinal radiograph series is below this). 5 rads has been proposed as the accepted cumulative dose of ionizing radiation during pregnancy. Non-urgent imaging should be avoided during the 10th to 17th weeks of gestation (most vulnerable period for central nervous system teratogenesis). Ultrasonography can be satisfactory, inexpensive, and a safe alternative to CT, which is of limited use as it requires high levels of ionizing radiation. MRI is typically ok but Gadolinium-based contrast should not be used as it crosses the placenta after intravenous injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Management/Treatment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most common, but controversial method is physical therapy. Those who present with both lumbar and pelvic pain symptoms should avoid back-strengthening exercises until the posterior pelvic symptoms resolve as they may worsen otherwise. The goal of exercise during pregnancy is to improve or maintain muscle tone and not to control weight gain or to correct posture. Hypertension, diabetes melitus, history of premature labor, placenta previa, threatened abortion, post date, and multiple gestations are all contraindications during pregnancy. In women with nocturnal pain, decreased time spent in the supine position may alleviate symptoms. Advising women to sleep on their side may help to reduce pressure on the vena cava and resolve pain that is possibly vascular in origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medications:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NSAIDs and other anti-prostaglandin medications are contraindicated during pregnancy. One potential intervention may be the use of relaxin receptor blockers or relaxin inhibitors, if conclusive evidence points to relaxin as a cause of low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, prevention is the key. Pain intensity during pregnancy has been positively associate with duration of pain postpartum. Women who did not have the ability to take breaks at work report experiencing back pain symptoms 6 years postpartum. Women who are more physically fit prepartum appear to have a reduced risk of developing lumbar pain during pregnancy.</p>\r\n', 'Pregnancy-Related Low Back Pain', 'pregnancy-related-low-back-pain', '2013/06/01', '0d8fb21f8b4357b8c28c51629', 1, 3, '2014-08-28 15:11:56', '', 'pregnancy.jpg');

Neural tube defects (NTD) occur at the very early stages of pregnancy, even before most women realize they are pregnant. This defect occurs in over 3,000 pregnancies a year in the United States. There are two types of NTD: open and closed. Open NTD is when the brain or spinal cord is exposed at birth. Closed NTD occurs when the hole exists, but is covered by a layer of skin. Women who are or might become pregnant need folic acid in their diet to prevent this birth defect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand the seriousness of NTD, it is best to learn some details about some of the possible conditions. Some types of open NTD conditions, when the brain tissue protrudes out of the skin from an abnormal opening in the skull, can result in the child being born blind, deaf, and unconscious. These infants are sometimes still born or die within a few hours. Other NTD can be surgically repaired, but may still result in severe neurological dysfunction. One type of closed NTD, spina bifida occulta, is actually benign and results in no symptoms or dysfunction. About 10-15% of the healthy population have this and do not know it. It usually is incidentally found on spinal X-rays. NTD can be identified by ultrasound, blood tests, or amniocentesis, but if it is not detected early on, can be immediately recognized at birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As type and level of severity differ among people with NTD, each person with the condition faces different challenges and may require different treatments ranging from surgical to non-surgical. The best way to manage NTD is with a team approach. Members of the team may include neurosurgeons, urologists, orthopedists, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, and medical social workers. The goal of treatment for NTD is to allow the individual to achieve the highest level of function and independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folic acid, also known as folate, is essential to the prevention of NTD. Folic acid is a vitamin that the body needs to grow and be healthy. Folate is used for the production and maintenance of new cells, for DNA synthesis, and RNA synthesis. Because of this, some research even suggests that folic acid can help prevent other birth defects as well such as cleft lip, cleft pallet, and congenital cardiac abnormalities. To reduce the risk of NTD and other birth defects, doctors recommend that women consume 4mg of folic acid each day at least one month prior to trying to become pregnant and during the first trimester.&nbsp; Since many pregnancies are unplanned, many expert groups suggest that women of child bearing age should take 4mg per day just to be safe. The neural tube, from which the baby&rsquo;s brain and spine will develop, begins to form 3 days after fertilization, so it is extremely important to have plenty of folic acid in your system to help support this process. Folic acid is found in many foods, but the man-made or synthetic form in pills is actually better absorbed by our bodies. Folate is found naturally in leafy vegetables like kale and spinach. It can also be found in orange juice or enriched grains like breakfast cereals, breads, pastas, and rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women with previous pregnancies resulting in NTD&rsquo;s should seek a physician&rsquo;s advice before attempting to get pregnant. Ask your OBGYN the best way for you to get folic acid in your diet if you are planning on pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;"><strong>Sources:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol style="font-size:10px;">\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:10px;">&ldquo;Folic Acid in Your Pregnancy Diet&rdquo; Reviewed by Baby Center Medical Adisory Board <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_folic-acid-in-your-pregnancy-diet_476.bc" target="_blank">http://www.babycenter.com/0_folic-acid-in-your-pregnancy-diet_476.bc</a></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:10px;">Folic acid supplementation can adversely affect murine neural tube closure and embryonic survival Amber Marean, Amanda Graf, Ying Zhang and Lee Niswander 2001</span></li>\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:10px;">&ldquo;Folic Acid and Pregnancy&rdquo; Reviewed by: Elana Pearl Ben-Joseph, MD <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/preg_folic_acid.html November 2011" target="_blank">http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_center/your_pregnancy/preg_folic_acid.html November 2011</a></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:10px;">&ldquo;Vitamins and Nutrition in Pregnancy&rdquo; <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/vitamins-minerals-supplements-pregnant.aspx 2011" target="_blank">http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/vitamins-minerals-supplements-pregnant.aspx 2011</a></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 'Folic Acid- Reducing the Risk of Spinal Cord Birth Defects', 'folic-acid--reducing-the-risk-of-spinal-cord-birth-defects', '2013/07/12', 'ce615b349bc36ed15000e5f3a', 1, 7, '2014-08-28 15:16:25', '', 'Folic_Acid.jpg');

Spinal cord compression, or narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck, can at times be asymptomatic except for some subtle changes in coordination. Of course this problem can also commonly cause neck and arm pain, numbness in the extremities, and weakness. However, it is when these symptoms are absent that this diagnosis can be difficult. It is important to seek evaluation of such symptoms as spinal cord compression can lead to a progressive deteriorating syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/file/spine1.jpg" style="width: 220px; height: 276px; float: right; margin:10px 0 10px 20px;" /><strong>Cervical myelopathy</strong> is the medical term that applies to this condition. With prolonged or severe spinal cord compression in the neck from bone spurs or a disc herniation, a patient can begin to experience neurologic symptoms. Symptoms associated with myelopathy can include clumsiness of the hands or feet, decreased coordination, balance issues, walking instability, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. In addition, a patient can have difficulty with fine motor movements such as handwriting, buttoning a shirt, picking up small objects, and/or dropping items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervical myelopathy can be a serious condition and if ignored can lead to permanent disabilities.&nbsp; These symptoms can often progress quickly, and if present for an extended period of time, cannot be corrected even with surgery. The goal of treatment is to alleviate the pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. This can only be accomplished through surgery. Surgery involves removing the structures pushing on the neurologic structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" height="180" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/file/spinal-chord2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px 10px 0px;" width="228" />This is often a disc herniation, bone spur, or thickened ligaments. Removing these structures requires secondary stabilization through a cervical fusion. Recovery from this procedure often involves an overnight stay in the hospital, use of a brace, and activity restriction for several weeks. However, patients are often released to progressive activity within one to two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often it is not intuitive that issues with balance or clumsiness can be secondary to a problem in your neck; especially if the neck is asymptomatic. Therefore, one of the most important jobs of a spine specialist is to educate patients with these issues on this condition and what signs and symptoms to watch for.&nbsp; If the patient has any progression of these symptoms, then they should seek immediate attention from a spine specialist.</p>\r\n', 'Could My Clumsiness Be Related To a Neck Problem?', 'could-my-clumsiness-be-related-to-a-neck-problem?', '2013/07/12', '7aa980e8e1139ae1657131b3a', 1, 2, '2014-08-28 15:18:44', '', 'clumsiness fe 07122013.jpg');

It has a 1% prevalence higher in Native Indian populations and an unknown etiology but genetic risk factors have been associated with HLA genes.&nbsp; Protective factors include pregnancy and birth control while breast feeding and smoking have been found to be risk factors.&nbsp; It involves all areas in tissues of the joints including tendon, ligament, bone and cartilage. <strong>(Figure 1)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/fig-1_harrod_081613.jpg" style="width: 474px; height: 367px;" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis has a multitude of differential diagnosis including viral polyarthritis, lupus, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, osteoarthritis, gout and CPPD.&nbsp; Lab work and workup including joint aspiration and radiographs of appropriate joints including flexion/extension views of the cervical spine are appropriate.&nbsp; Treatment is primarily conservative with medications including disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs which have transformed the field and surgery for deformity typically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis is noted. <strong>(Table 1)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/table-1_harrod_081613.jpg" style="width: 474px; height: 240px;" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a Type III hypersensitivity reaction in which immunoglobulins form immune complexes which are then causing an inflammatory response in the joint and affect the synovial lining.<strong>(Figure 1)</strong>&nbsp; A typical pathologic high powered specimen is viewed with multiple inflammatory cells lining the joint cavity.&nbsp; Typically T lymphocytes and macrophages are involved form a pannus formation which then has a second influx in production of cytokines and multiple chemotactic factors which then cause and induce destruction of all tissues within the joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rheumatoid myelopathy (or spinal cord dysfunction)&nbsp; typically involves atlantoaxial subluxation, or instability between the first two neck bones, <strong>(Figure 2)</strong> subaxial subluxation (instability or compression below the second neck bone) and basilar invagination, or brainstem compression, <strong>(Figure 3)</strong>&nbsp; as the presenting radiographic findings.&nbsp;Myelopathy is classified by subjective (patient reported) weakness with abnormal reflexes, objective weakness (on exam), and ambulatory status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/fig-2_harrod_081613.jpg" style="width: 168px;

The space available for the cord was characterized by Boutin, et al in JVJS, 1992, and when less than thirteen decreased neurologic outcomes are expected. <strong>(Figure 5)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/fig-4_harrod_081613.jpg" style="width: 184px;

The atlantoaxial instability algorithm begins by determining whether or not the deformity is fixed on flexion/extension views.&nbsp; If it is not fixed, then the treatment is reduction and a posterior C1-C2 fusion.&nbsp; If it is fixed, preoperative traction versus supine positioning and intraoperative traction with a lateral fluoroscopy shot will demonstrate a reduction or not.&nbsp; If it does reduce, then you should flip the patient prone and do a C1-C2 posterior fusion.&nbsp; If it does not reduce, a transoral release with rarely an odontoidectomy is indicated and then a prone positioning with a posterior stabilization procedure.&nbsp; Please note, a C1 laminectomy is rarely needed as the primary problem is a combination typically from an anterior pannus, fixed C0-C1 or C1-C2 joints or severe basilar invagination.<strong> (Figure 6)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/fig-6_harrod_081613.jpg" style="width: 474px;

X-rays demonstrate a reducible atlantoaxial instability but dynamic cord compression with the space available for the cord of 6.0.&nbsp; However, the large vertebral arteries (going to the back of the brain) are abnormal in the second cervical bone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

A heavy back pack can distort the natural curvature of the middle and lower back, which will cause muscle strains and irritation to spinal joints. Beyond the damage that a heavy back can cause, the child&#39;s balance will be impacted by the load, leaving them more prone to fall when walking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What exactly do we mean by a heavy back pack? For an average adult, carrying a 15-lb. bag would not feel taxing, but when children weigh only 60 pounds, this represents 25% of their body weight! Most literature on the subject encourages children to carry no more than 10% of their bodyweight.&nbsp;Of course, this requires the student to be aware of what is necessary to bring home each night. Are all the books needed? Are all the supplies needed?&nbsp; It might be beneficial to contact the teacher to find out what your child does or does not need each night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One should not only consider the weight that children carry but how they carry their bag.&nbsp; If your child wears a back pack engaging only one strap, then the weight of the bag is not evenly distributed over the entire back.&nbsp; It is important that both straps be used, which will help distribute the load more evenly.&nbsp;In addition, the straps should be snug so that the bag sits higher on the back.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right bag is also important. A good back pack should be made with lighter materials, such as canvas. It should offer wide, padded shoulder straps and padding along the back, which helps cushion any rebound or impact from books or supplies. Also consider one with a waist strap that will help redistribute the weight. There are also roller back packs; however those can be difficult to maneuver and difficult to use with stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If parents and students start with a good back pack, then take some basic preventative steps, avoiding unnecessary items and heavy weights, along with proper fitting, harmful issues can be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><strong>Sources</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.healio.com/orthopedics/journals/ORTHO/%7B41EE9B99-F011-4FDF-94FD-5CCD9F65F7B3%7D/Effects of-Backpack-Carrying-in-Children"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://www.healio.com/orthopedics/journals/ORTHO/%7B41EE9B99-F011-4FDF-94FD-5CCD9F65F7B3%7D/Effects</span> <span style="font-size:11px;">of-Backpack-Carrying-in-Children</span></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.spine-health.com/wellness/ergonomics/backpacks-and-back-pain-children"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://www.spine-health.com/wellness/ergonomics/backpacks-and-back-pain-children</span></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.spine-health.com/wellness/ergonomics/tips-prevent-back-pain-kids-backpacks"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://www.spine-health.com/wellness/ergonomics/tips-prevent-back-pain-kids-backpacks</span></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=486183"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=486183</span></a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11px;">â€‹</span><a href="/newsletter/0813/index_email.html" target="_blank">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n', 'Back Packs And Back Pain', 'back-packs-and-back-pain', '2013/08/16', 'c4b572f2bb72aea9dc5eff671', 1, 5, '2014-08-28 15:21:35', '', 'backpack with back pain fe 08162013.jpg');

In particular, when compared with no exercise, trunk strengthening is effective for reducing pain and improving function.&nbsp;Alternatives to walking outdoors or on a treadmill include walking in a pool and swimming.&nbsp; Both will provide the same aerobic benefits as walking without the added strain to your joints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step is to start an aerobic exercise schedule which will establish a baseline for your overall health and tolerance for exercise.&nbsp;Once you have determined your baseline, you should introduce stretches and exercises that will strengthen both your back and your core.&nbsp;With any exercise regimen, you should integrate exercises slowly and with a low number of repetitions to ascertain your physical ability and pain tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you should not attempt exercises that will negatively impact your back.&nbsp;For example, leg lifts, traditional, bent and flat leg sit-ups, lifting weights above the waist, and toe touches all place strain on your lower back that may exacerbate your back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="/images/uploads/water-aerobics.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" />For an easier and safer way to exercise, try performing exercises that you can do either on your back (so that you are not placing strain on the lower back) or sitting in a chair (which will help minimize the impact on your back).&nbsp;Additionally, exercises should be performed in gentle and smooth motions so that you do not accidentally place strain on you back with violent and unexpected motions.&nbsp;Simple exercises that will accomplish these goals are knee to chest stretches, which can be performed either seated or lying down, and rotational stretching, which is accomplished when lying on your back you rotate your legs, with knees bent, to either side of your body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter which approach you take, exercising on your own or enlisting the services of a personal trainer, the most sensible approach will be the most beneficial for exercising with back pain.&nbsp;Many websites, including <u>WedMD</u> and the <u>Mayo Clinic</u>, offer visual guides on exercising with back pains; however, you have to know your own limit.&nbsp;If something does not feel right, you should not attempt to push through the discomfort, as you could be causing more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="/newsletter/0913">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11px;"><strong>Sources:</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:11px;">Lillios, S., &amp; Young, J.

In recent years, however, technological advances have allowed more back and neck conditions to be treated with a minimally invasive surgical technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), does not involve a long incision, it avoids significant damage to the muscles surrounding the spine. In most cases, this results in less pain after surgery and a faster recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spine surgery is typically recommended only when a period of nonsurgical treatment &mdash; such as medications and physical therapy &mdash; has not relieved the painful symptoms caused by your back problem. In addition, surgery is only considered if your doctor can pinpoint the exact source of your pain, such as a herniated disk or spinal stenosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,.5); float:right; width:35%; padding:10px 5px; margin:10px 20px;">\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00543F01.jpg" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size:12px;">This illustration shows the incision site in the lower back that is used for some traditional spine surgeries. </span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive techniques are beginning to be used for a wider range of spine procedures, and have been used for common procedures like decompression and spinal fusion since the 1990s. Decompression relieves pressure put on spinal nerves by removing portions of bone or a herniated disk. Spinal fusion corrects problems with the small bones of the spine (vertebrae). The basic idea is to fuse together the painful vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. This article focuses on decompression and fusion with a minimally invasive technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) is sometimes called less invasive spine surgery. In these procedures, doctors use specialized instruments to access the spine through small incisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a traditional, open surgery, the doctor makes an incision that is 5 to 6 in. long and moves the muscles to the side in order to see the spine. With the muscles pulled to the side, the surgeon can access the spine to remove diseased and damaged bone or intevertebral disks. The surgeon can also easily see to place screws, cages, and any bone graft materials necessary to stabilize the spinal bones and promote healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the major drawbacks of open surgery is that the pulling or &quot;retraction&quot; of the muscle can damage the soft tissue. Although the goal of muscle retraction is to help the surgeon see the problem area, it typically affects more anatomy than the surgeon requires. As a result, there is greater potential for muscle injury, and patients may have pain after surgery that is different from the back pain felt before surgery. This can lead to a lengthier recovery period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive spine surgery was developed to treat spine problems with less injury to the muscles and other normal structures in the spine. It also helps the surgeon to see only where the problem exists in the spine. Other advantages to MISS include smaller incisions, less bleeding, and shorter stays in the hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,.5); padding:10px; margin:10px 20px;">\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00543F02.jpg" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>(Left)</strong> In open surgery, muscles surrounding the spine are pulled back to reveal the bones. <strong>(Right)</strong> After removing portions of the bone (a decompression procedure called laminectomy), bone graft material and screws are placed along the sides of the vertebrae.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Procedure</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,.5); float:right; width:40%; padding:10px 5px; margin:10px 20px;">\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00543F03.jpg" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size:12px;">A tubular retractor is used to create a passageway for the surgeon to reach the problem area of the lower back. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;"><em>Reproduced from Anderson D, Tannoury C: Minimally invasive lumbar surgery, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons website: Orthopaedic Knowledge Online Journal, 2007.&nbsp;</em></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>MISS fusions and decompression procedures (such as diskectomy and laminectomy) are performed with special tools called tubular retractors. During the procedure, a small incision is made and the tubular retractor is inserted through the skin and soft tissues down to the spinal column. This creates a tunnel to the small area where the problem exists in the spine. The tubular retractor holds the muscles open and is kept in place throughout the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgeon accesses the spine using small instruments that fit through the center of the tubular retractor. Any bone or disk material that is removed exits through the retractor, and any devices necessary for fusion &mdash; such as screws or rods &mdash; are inserted through the retractor. Some surgeries require more than one retractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to see where to place the incision and insert the retractor, the surgeon is guided by fluoroscopy. This method displays real-time x-ray images of the patient&#39;s spine on a screen throughout the surgery. The surgeon also uses an operating microscope to magnify the view through the retractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the procedure, the tubular retractor is removed and the muscles return to original position. This limits the muscle damage that is more commonly seen in open surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,.5); padding:10px; margin:10px 20px;">\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00543F05.jpg" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size:12px;">(Left) An illustration showing a cross-section view of a healthy intevertebral disk.

To surgically relieve these symptoms, the disk is removed. This procedure is called a diskectomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the surgery, the patient is positioned face-down and a small incision (sometimes less than 1 in.) is made over the location of the herniated disk. The surgeon inserts the retractor and removes a small amount of the lamina bone. This provides the surgeon with a view of the spinal nerve and the disk. The surgeon carefully retracts the nerve, removes the damaged disk, and replaces it with bone graft material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This minimally invasive technique can also be used for herniated disks in the neck. The procedure is done through the back of the neck and called an MIS posterior cervical diskectomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,.5); float:right; width:40%; padding:10px 5px; margin:10px 20px;">\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00543F07.jpg" width="100%" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size:12px;">A small instrument is inserted through the tubular retractor to remove a herniated disk. Screws to support the fusion are placed in the bone through both retractors.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MIS Lumbar Fusion:</strong> A standard, open lumbar fusion may be performed from the back, through the abdomen, or from the side. Minimally invasive lumbar fusions can be done the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common MISS fusion is the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) Using this technique, the surgeon approaches the spine a little bit from the side, which reduces how much the spinal nerve must be moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an MIS TLIF, the patient is positioned face-down and the surgeon places one retractor on either side of the spine. This approach prevents disruption of the midline ligaments and bone. Using the two retractors, the surgeon can remove the lamina and the disk, place the bone graft into the disk space, and place screws or rods to provide additional support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Approaching the spine slightly from the side does not provide the surgeon with a full view and it is often a challenge to remove the disk completely. This may make fusion healing more difficult. Sometimes the surgeon will use additional bone graft besides the patient&#39;s own bone to improve the likelihood of healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive spinal fusion is also commonly performed from the side. There are two procedures that use a side approach: extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) and direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF). The benefits of these lateral fusion surgeries are that they do not injure the muscles in the back and they do not tug or pull on the nerves in the spinal canal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Complications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any operation, there are potential risks associated with MISS. Complications of MISS are similar to open spinal fusion surgeries, however, some studies show a reduced infection rate for MISS. It is important to discuss these risks with your surgeon before your procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection.</strong> Antibiotics are regularly given to the patient before, during, and often after surgery to lessen the risk of infections.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Bleeding.</strong> A certain amount of bleeding is expected, but this is not typically significant.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Pain at graft site.</strong> A small percentage of patients will experience persistent pain at the bone graft site.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Recurring symptoms.</strong> Some patients may experience a recurrence of their original symptoms.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Pseudarthrosis.</strong> Patients who smoke are more likely to develop a pseudarthrosis. This is a condition where there is not enough bone formation. If this occurs, a second surgery may needed in order to obtain a solid fusion.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Nerve damage.</strong> It is possible that the nerves or blood vessels may be injured during these operations. These complications are very rare.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Blood clots.</strong> Another uncommon complication is the formation of blood clots in the legs. These pose significant danger if they break off and travel to the lungs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Recovery</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures can shorten hospital stays. The exact length of time needed in the hospital will vary with each patient and individual procedure, but generally, MISS patients go home in 2 to 3 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because minimally invasive techniques do not disrupt muscles and soft tissues, it is believed that post-operative pain is less than pain after traditional, open procedures. You should still expect to feel some discomfort, however, advancements in pain control now make it easier for your doctor to manage and relieve pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help you regain strength and speed your recovery, your doctor may recommend physical therapy. This will depend on the procedure you have had and your general physical condition. Specific exercises will help you become strong enough to return to work and daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have had a fusion procedure, it may be several months before the bone is solid, although your comfort level will often improve much faster. During this healing time, the fused spine must be kept in proper alignment. You will be taught how to move properly, reposition, sit, stand, and walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long it will take to return to your daily activities after MISS depends upon your individual procedure and condition. Your doctor will evaluate you after your surgery to make sure that your recovery is progressing as expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:12px;">This article is property of American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

Although there is very little research on this topic, it is a common thought among medical providers that there is indeed a link. Very heavy breasts are thought to commonly cause neck pain, shoulder pain, and back pain. Other effects can include damage to soft tissue and shaping of the skeletal anatomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin: 10px; padding: 10px 0px; width: 35%; float: right;">\r\n<p><img alt="Proper Bra Fitting" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/get-fitted-bra-fitting.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size: 12px;">Professional Bra Fitting</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common piece of advice given to women with large breast size is to have a professional fitting for a full back support bra. Many studies in recent years indicate that over 70% of women are actually wearing the wrong bra size. Wearing undergarments that don&#39;t fit can have medical repercussions including muscle tightening and pain, increased likelihood of dysfunctional segments in the upper back, added stress on bones and muscles leading to breathing problems, and even constriction of the rib cage with resultant digestion affects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A properly fitted full back support bra&nbsp;can decrease pain, increase quality of life, improve breathing, and even reduce fatigue. While extremely beneficial, one must be aware that such bras are more expensive and less fashionable. It is recommended that when selecting a bra, &quot;buy quality&quot; and it will not only give better results but last longer and require fewer purchases over time. Wardrobes can be adjusted to better cover unflattering and less fashionable undergarments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, it is commonly thought that large breast size can lead to neck and back pain. A high quality, full back support bra can help reduce tension on the upper and lower back and ultimately help reduce chronic pain. When considering spending a bit of extra money on that next undergarment, splurge for your spine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1013">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n', 'Support Bras for Women & Their Benefits for Reducing Back Pain', 'support-bras-for-women---their-benefits-for-reducing-back-pain', '2013/10/25', 'e2ccdd697626c4a3d80290583', 1, 1, '2014-08-28 15:27:38', '', 'support bras fe 10252013.jpg');
INSERT INTO `blogPosts` VALUES (13, 'American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons', 'http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00311', '\r\n\r\n<p>Almost everyone will experience low back pain at some point in their lives. This pain can vary from mild to severe. It can be short-lived or long-lasting. However it happens, low back pain can make many everyday activities difficult to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding your spine and how it works can help you understand why you have low back pain. Your spine is made up of small bones, called vertebrae, which are stacked on top of one another. Muscles, ligaments, nerves, and intervertebral disks are additional parts of your spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Anatomy</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt="Parts of the lumbar spine. " src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F01.jpg" style="opacity: 0.9; width: 250px; height: 247px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vertebrae</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">These bones connect to create a canal that protects the spinal cord. The spinal column is made up of three sections that create three natural curves in your back: the curves of the neck area (cervical), chest area (thoracic), and lower back (lumbar). The lower section of your spine (sacrum and coccyx) is made up of vertebrae that are fused together.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five lumbar vertebrae connect the upper spine to the pelvis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spinal Cord and Nerves</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;">These &quot;electrical cables&quot; travel through the spinal canal carrying messages between your brain and muscles. Nerves branch out from the spinal cord through openings in the vertebrae.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Muscles and Ligaments </strong>-&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;">These provide support and stability for your spine and upper body. Strong ligaments connect your vertebrae and help keep the spinal column in position.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Facet Joints</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;">Between vertebrae are small joints that help your spine move.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Healthy intervertebral disk (cross-section view)." src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F02.jpg" style="opacity: 0.9; width: 250px; height: 192px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Intervertebral Disks</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Intervertebral disks sit in between the vertebrae.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you walk or run, the disks act as shock absorbers and prevent the vertebrae from bumping against one another. They work with your facet joints to help your spine move, twist, and bend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intervertebral disks are flat and round, and about a half inch thick. They are made up of two components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Annulus fibrosus</strong>&nbsp;- This is the tough, flexible outer ring of the disk. It helps connect to the vertebrae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nucleus pulposus</strong>&nbsp;- This is the soft, jelly-like center of the annulus fibrosus. It gives the disk its shock-absorbing capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Causes of Back Pain</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Lumbar ligament tear. " src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F03.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 206px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" />There are many causes of low back pain. It sometimes occurs after a specific movement such as lifting or bending. Just getting older also plays a role in many back conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we age, our spines age with us. Aging causes degenerative changes in the spine. These changes can start in our 30s &mdash; or even younger &mdash; and can make us prone to back pain, especially if we overdo our activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These aging changes, however, do not keep most people from leading productive, and generally, pain-free lives. We have all seen the 70-year-old marathon runner who, without a doubt, has degenerative changes in her back!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Over-activity</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">One of the more common causes of low back pain is muscle soreness from over-activity. Muscles and ligament fibers can be overstretched or injured.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is often brought about by that first softball or golf game of the season, or too much yard work or snow shoveling in one day. We are all familiar with this &quot;stiffness&quot; and soreness in the low back &mdash; and other areas of the body &mdash; that usually goes away within a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disk Injury</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Some people develop low back pain that does not go away within days. This may mean there is an injury to a disk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disk tear. Small tears to the outer part of the disk (annulus) sometimes occur with aging. Some people with disk tears have no pain at all. Others can have pain that lasts for weeks, months, or even longer. A small number of people may develop constant pain that lasts for years and is quite disabling. Why some people have pain and others do not is not well understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disk herniation. Another common type of disk injury is a &quot;slipped&quot; or herniated disc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Herniated disk" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F04.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 198px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" />A disk herniates when its jelly-like center (nucleus) pushes against its outer ring (annulus). If the disk is very worn or injured, the nucleus may squeeze all the way through. When the herniated disk bulges out toward the spinal canal, it puts pressure on the sensitive spinal nerves, causing pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because a herniated disk in the low back often puts pressure on the nerve root leading to the leg and foot, pain often occurs in the buttock and down the leg. This is sciatica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A herniated disk often occurs with lifting, pulling, bending, or twisting movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Disk degeneration" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F05.jpg" style="opacity: 0.9; width: 100px; height: 166px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disk Degeneration</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">With age, intevertebral disks begin to wear away and shrink. In some cases, they may collapse completely and cause the facet joints in the vertebrae to rub against one another. Pain and stiffness result.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &quot;wear and tear&quot; on the facet joints is referred to as osteoarthritis. It can lead to further back problems, including spinal stenosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Spondylolisthesis" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F06.jpg" style="opacity: 0.9; width: 100px; height: 156px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Degenerative Spondylolisthesis</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">(Spon-dee-low-lis-THEE-sis). Changes from aging and general wear and tear make it hard for your joints and ligaments to keep your spine in the proper position. The vertebrae move more than they should, and one vertebra can slide forward on top of another. If too much slippage occurs, the bones may begin to press on the spinal nerves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spinal Stenosis</strong><br />\r\n<img alt="Spinal Stenosis" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00311F07.jpg" style="opacity: 0.9; width: 200px; height: 198px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" /><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Spinal stenosis occurs when the space around the spinal cord narrows and puts pressure on the cord and spinal nerves.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When intervertebral disks collapse and osteoarthritis develops, your body may respond by growing new bone in your facet joints to help support the vertebrae. Over time, this bone overgrowth - called spurs - can lead to a narrowing of the spinal canal. Osteoarthritis can also cause the ligaments that connect vertebrae to thicken, which can narrow the spinal canal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scoliosis</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">This is an abnormal curve of the spine that may develop in children, most often during their teenage years. It also may develop in older patients who have arthritis. This spinal deformity may cause back pain and possibly leg symptoms, if pressure on the nerves is involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional Causes</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">There are other causes of back pain, some of which can be serious. If you have vascular or arterial disease, a history of cancer, or pain that is always there despite your activity level or position, you should consult your primary care doctor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Symptoms</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Back pain varies. It may be sharp or stabbing. It can be dull, achy, or feel like a &quot;charley horse&quot; type cramp. The type of pain you have will depend on the underlying cause of your back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people find that reclining or lying down will improve low back pain, no matter the underlying cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People with low back pain may experience some of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Back pain may be worse with bending and lifting.</li>\r\n	<li>Sitting may worsen pain.</li>\r\n	<li>Standing and walking may worsen pain</li>\r\n	<li>Back pain comes and goes, and often follows an up and down course with good days and bad days.</li>\r\n	<li>Pain may extend from the back into the buttock or outer hip area, but not down the leg.</li>\r\n	<li>Sciatica is common with a herniated disk. This includes buttock and leg pain, and even numbness, tingling or weakness that goes down to the foot. It is possible to have sciatica without back pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of your age or symptoms, if your back pain does not get better within a few weeks, or is associated with fever, chills, or unexpected weight loss, you should call your doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Tests and Diagnosis</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Medical History and Physical Examination</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After discussing your symptoms and medical history, your doctor will examine your back. This will include looking at your back and pushing on different areas to see if it hurts. Your doctor may have you bend forward, backward, and side to side to look for limitations or pain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor may measure the nerve function in your legs. This includes checking your reflexes at your knees and ankles, as well as strength testing and sensation testing. This might tell your doctor if the nerves are seriously affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Imaging Tests</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Other tests which may help your doctor confirm your diagnosis include:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>X-rays</strong>&nbsp;- Although they only visualize bones, simple X-rays can help determine if you have the most obvious causes of back pain. It will show broken bones, aging changes, curves, or deformities. X-rays do not show disks, muscles, or nerves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong>&nbsp;- This study can create better images of soft tissues, such as muscles, nerves, and spinal disks. Conditions such as a herniated disk or an infection are more visible in an MRI scan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans</strong>&nbsp;- If your doctor suspects a bone problem, he or she may suggest a CAT scan. This study is like a three-dimensional X-ray and focuses on the bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bone scan</strong>&nbsp;- A bone scan may be suggested if your doctor needs more information to evaluate your pain and to make sure that the pain is not from a rare problem like cancer or infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bone density test</strong>&nbsp;- If osteoporosis is a concern, your doctor may order a bone density test. Osteoporosis weakens bone and makes it more likely to break. Osteoporosis by itself should not cause back pain, but spinal fractures due to osteoporosis can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Treatment</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, treatment for low back pain falls into one of three categories: medications, physical medicine, and surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nonsurgical Treatment</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Medications. Several medications may be used to help relieve your pain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aspirin or acetaminophen can relieve pain with few side effects.</li>\r\n	<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling.</li>\r\n	<li>Narcotic pain medications, such as codeine or morphine, may help.</li>\r\n	<li>Steroids, taken either orally or injected into your spine, deliver a high dose of anti-inflammatory medicine.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Physical medicine</strong> -&nbsp;Low back pain can be disabling. Medications and therapeutic treatments combined often relieve pain enough for you to do all the things you want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Physical therapy can include passive modalities such as heat, ice, massage, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation. Active therapy consists of stretching, weight lifting, and cardiovascular exercises. Exercising to restore motion and strength to your lower back can be very helpful in relieving pain.</li>\r\n	<li>Braces are often used. The most common brace is a corset-type that can be wrapped around the back and stomach. Braces are not always helpful, but some people report feeling more comfortable and stable while wearing them.</li>\r\n	<li>Chiropractic or manipulation therapy is provided in many different forms. Some patients have relief from low back pain with these treatments.</li>\r\n	<li>Traction is often used, but without scientific evidence for effectiveness.</li>\r\n	<li>Other exercise-based programs, such as Pilates or yoga are helpful for some patients.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Surgical Treatment</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Surgery for low back pain should only be considered when nonsurgical treatment options have been tried and have failed. It is best to try nonsurgical options for 6 months to a year before considering surgery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, surgery should only be considered if you doctor can pinpoint the source of your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surgery is not a last resort treatment option &quot;when all else fails.&quot; Some patients are not candidates for surgery, even though they have significant pain and other treatments have not worked. Some types of chronic low back pain simply can not be treated with surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spinal Fusion&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>This is essentially a &quot;welding&quot; process. The basic idea is to fuse together the painful vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spinal fusion eliminates motion between vertebral segments. It is an option when motion is the source of pain. For example, your doctor may recommend spinal fusion if you have spinal instability, a bad curvature (scoliosis), or severe degeneration of one or more of your disks. The theory is if the painful spine segments do not move, they should not hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fusion of the vertebrae in the lower back has been performed for decades. A variety of surgical techniques have evolved. In most cases, a bone graft is used to fuse the vertebrae. Screws, rods, or a &quot;cage&quot; are used to keep your spine stable while the bone graft heals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery can be done through your abdomen, your side, your back, or a combination of these. There is even a procedure that is done through a small opening next to your tailbone. No one procedure has been proven better than another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of spinal fusion for low back pain vary. It can be very effective at eliminating pain, not work at all, and everything in between. Full recovery can take more than a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disc Replacement</strong> -&nbsp;This procedure involves removing the disk and replacing it with artificial parts, similar to replacements of the hip or knee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of disk replacement is to allow the spinal segment to keep some flexibility and maintain more normal motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surgery is done through your abdomen, usually on the lower two disks of the spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style="font-size:18px;">Prevention</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It may not be possible to prevent low back pain. We cannot avoid the normal wear and tear on our spines that goes along with aging. But there are things we can do to lessen the impact of low back problems. Having a healthy lifestyle is a good start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Combine aerobic exercise, like walking or swimming, with specific exercises to keep the muscles in your back and abdomen strong and flexible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Proper Lifting</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Be sure to lift heavy items with your legs, not your back. Do not bend over to pick something up. Keep your back straight and bend at your knees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weight</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight puts added stress on your lower back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avoid Smoking</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Both the smoke and the nicotine cause your spine to age faster than normal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Proper Posture</strong><br />\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Good posture is important for avoiding future problems. A therapist can teach you how to safely stand, sit, and lift.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1113">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00543" target="_blank">Read the article on aaos.org</a></p>\r\n', 'Understanding Low Back Pain and How Your Spine Works', 'understanding-low-back-pain-and-how-your-spine-works', '2013/11/25', '8eab08f49f4471824720951ed', 1, 2, '2014-08-28 15:28:30', '', 'understanding back pain fe.  11252013.jpg');

Although there is very little research on this topic, it is a common thought among medical providers that there is indeed a link. Very heavy breasts are thought to commonly cause neck pain, shoulder pain, and back pain. Other effects can include damage to soft tissue and shaping of the skeletal anatomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin: 10px; padding: 10px 0px; width: 35%; float: right;">\r\n<p><img alt="Proper Bra Fitting" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/get-fitted-bra-fitting.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /><br />\r\n<span style="font-size: 12px;">Professional Bra Fitting</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common piece of advice given to women with large breast size is to have a professional fitting for a full back support bra. Many studies in recent years indicate that over 70% of women are actually wearing the wrong bra size. Wearing undergarments that don&#39;t fit can have medical repercussions including muscle tightening and pain, increased likelihood of dysfunctional segments in the upper back, added stress on bones and muscles leading to breathing problems, and even constriction of the rib cage with resultant digestion affects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A properly fitted full back support bra&nbsp;can decrease pain, increase quality of life, improve breathing, and even reduce fatigue. While extremely beneficial, one must be aware that such bras are more expensive and less fashionable. It is recommended that when selecting a bra, &quot;buy quality&quot; and it will not only give better results but last longer and require fewer purchases over time. Wardrobes can be adjusted to better cover unflattering and less fashionable undergarments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, it is commonly thought that large breast size can lead to neck and back pain. A high quality, full back support bra can help reduce tension on the upper and lower back and ultimately help reduce chronic pain. When considering spending a bit of extra money on that next undergarment, splurge for your spine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1013">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n', 'Support Bras for Women & Their<br> Benefits for Reducing Back Pain', 'support-bras-for-women---their<br>-benefits-for-reducing-back-pain', '2013/10/25', '89924e9f8d6de9792a7e5b587', 0, 1, '2014-08-28 15:30:19', '', '');

Different methods of dry needling are examined, including effectiveness and potential benefits for those patients suffering from acute or chronic pain and sore muscles, as well as potential adverse effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin:0 0 15px 15px;" width="50%">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="padding:5px;" width="132"><img alt="Iliac Crest" src="http://www.jabfm.org/content/23/5/640/F1.large.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 100%;" /></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="padding:5px;"><em><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Examples of dry needling applications. </strong><br />\r\n			A: Marking out the quadratus lumborum muscle before needling. B: Needling the paraspinal muscles.</span></em></td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Dry needling consists of the insertion of a filament needle into muscles that are identified as causing the patient pain. According to Kalichman and Vulfsons (2010), dry needling is &quot;minimally invasive, cheap . . . [treatment that] carries a low risk.&quot; A common misconception is that dry needling and acupuncture are identical procedures. While there are similarities, dry needling is not another name for acupuncture. Acupuncture therapy relies on traditional Chinese healing concepts of Qi and meridians; dry needling is a Western approach to pain management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The needles used in this procedure are very thin, and there is no solution injected (hence, &quot;dry needling&quot;). In fact, most patients fail to recognize when there is the actual insertion of the needle if there is no stimulation of the pain centers. A practitioner will insert the needle into the muscle with the aim of locating &quot;trigger points.&quot; Trigger points can be thought of as the source of the muscle pain, which will then radiate out to the surrounding muscle area. By inserting the needle into the trigger point, the practitioner wants to engage the trigger point. Engaging the trigger point will hopefully deactivate these pain centers. While it is possible for patients to gain immediate relief from the technique, most patients receive most benefit through a series of treatments over several weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the needle does engage a trigger point, the patient may experience a sudden, localized pain, which may feel to the patient like a muscle cramp--the severity of which will vary from patient to patient, depending on the patient&#39;s pain tolerance and the underlying condition. In addition to the associated pain of the treatment, dry needling, much like any medical treatment, has associated risks. One such risk is related to the location of the musculoskeletal pain, which can present challenges in treatment. For example, if the pain is close to an organ, the practitioner must demonstrate care so as not to insert the needle into the organ. Studies have also noted patient complaints of soreness, local hemorrhages, muscle damage and passing out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients desiring pain relief may benefit from dry needling. Before seeking treatment, the patient must be aware of the qualifications and licensure of the practitioner and the potential complications from the practice. If the patient does proceed with treatment, communication of symptoms and pains must be accurate and thorough so that the dry needling can produce the best outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style="font-size:11px;">Sources</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.jabfm.org/content/23/5/640.full#sec-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://www.jabfm.org/content/23/5/640.full#sec-5</span></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.kinetacore.com/physical-therapy/Trigger-Point-Dry-Needling/page150.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://www.kinetacore.com/physical-therapy/Trigger-Point-Dry-Needling/page150.html</span></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://m.prevention.com/health/health-concerns/dry-needling-and-acupuncture-pain-relief" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:11px;">http://m.prevention.com/health/health-concerns/dry-needling-and-acupuncture-pain-relief</span></a><br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1113">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n', 'â€œEver Heard of Dry Needling?â€ Patient Questions & Answers', 'ever-heard-of-dry-needling-patient-questions-answers', '2013/11/25', 'f1bd46f9552d865546176eade', 1, 5, '2014-08-28 15:32:35', '', '');

Unfortunately, accidents occur in these activities with various injuries. The human spine can be the site of such injury. It is important to understand the types of injury that can occur. With this knowledge injuries can be reduced and in some cases prevented. Also of importance is to recognize when these injuries occur. Sports and recreational activities play a major role in injury of the spine. It is estimated that almost 15% of spine injuries in the United States are related to sport or recreational activity (Fayssoux and Rhee, 2012). The type of injury to the spine depends of the mechanisms and load on the spine with different activities showing different patterns of injury. These injuries include muscloligamentous injury, disk herniation, fracture, subluxation, dislocation, burners, and spinal cord injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musculoligamentous injuries are injuries to the muscle and ligaments in and around the spine. These injuries are common in sport and are similar to whiplash injuries from motor vehicle accidents. They are usually caused by violent bending and/or rotation of the neck. These injuries are common in high impact and high speed activities such as football and skiing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Skiing" border="0" src="http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/snow-skiing-equipment-1.jpg" style="margin:0 15px 15px 0" width="299" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants wear helmets and the force is transmitted to the neck. These types of injuries to the mid-back and low back can occur in these activities as well. Disk herniation is not a common sports injury, but can occur. This type of injury can present as just neck or back pain, radiating pain to the arm or legs, injury to the spinal cord or a condition called cauda equina syndrome. These injuries are usually the result of pressure and twisting on the spine. Fractures, dislocations, and subluxations (partial dislocations) of the spine can occur depending on the mechanism of injury (Fayssoux and Rhee, 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Injury to the nerves and spinal cord also occur in sport or recreational activity. One of the more common injuries to occur is neurapraxia. Neurapraxia is commonly known as a burner or stinger. This injury occurs from a traction or stretch injury to the nerves near the neck or arm. Up to 65% of college football players are affected during a four year college football career. These injuries can also occur in non-contact sports. A baseball player sliding head first into a base is a good example. Although a rare occurrence spinal cord injury injuries in sport and recreational activities are the second most common cause of spinal cord injury in developed countries. Injuries can include a complete disruption of the spinal cord or partial disruption. The location of the injury to the cord can have varying effects. Neurapraxia of the cervical cord can also occur. This can lead to a temporary paralysis. As previously stated, injury to the thoracolumbar cord can result from large disk herniations. This can occur in activities such as downhill skiing and snowboarding (Fayssoux and Rhee, 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The education and athletes, coaches, and referees in sport-specific dangers, the use of proper athletic equipment and safe venues, and the preparation of medical staff are all important to providing a safe environment for athletic competition (Fayssoux and Rhee, 2012).&rdquo; Prevention of sport related back injury is aimed at decreasing the incidence and severity of injury to participants. Supervision, protective equipment, sport-specific athletic training, and preparation should all be considered to help prevent injury. If a suspected spine injury does occur the first goal is to prevent further damage. In order to do this a high index of suspicion needs to be present. Finally, a person with new severe neck pain, back pain, neurologic symptoms, or unconscious should be treated as an unstable spine fracture until proven otherwise (Fayssoux and Rhee, 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sport and recreation should be enjoyed and is a healthy past time for most people. Good judgment, awareness of potential injury, proper safety equipment and overall preparedness are a necessity. If a suspected injury does occur, remember the aim is to prevent further damage. Spine injuries are medical emergencies and need to be evaluated by qualified healthcare professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Sources:</strong><br />\r\nFayssoux, R.

The accomplishment of a successful spinal fusion depends upon the stability, good blood supply and and osteoinductive (ability of the patient to initiate bone growth) and osteoconductive (bone graft platform on which to grow) elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospect of a successful fusion depends on four distinct processes: osteogenesis (bone forming cells), osteoinduction, osteoconduction and lack of motion or stability. Osteogenesis describes the process of new bone formation occurring at a cellular level (i.e., stem cells). Osteoinduction is the recruitment and growth of cells that are key for new bone formation; an osteoinductive material must contain one or more growth factors that can induce new bone growth by osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). Osteoconduction is defined as the apposition of growing bone to the three-dimensional surface of the graft structural scaffold with the graft providing the framework for the ingrowth of the tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of autogenous bone graft (a patient&rsquo;s own bone graft), due to its intrinsic osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, makes it an optimum graft source for a spinal fusion. In addition modern surgical techniques provide early stability through the use of spinal instrumentation; nonetheless, long-term stability is dependent on the development of a solid biologic fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Principles of Bone Grafting in Spinal Fusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The patient must have multiple factors to obtain a solid spinal fusion. The presence of an adequate blood supply is essential and may be minimally disrupted through careful surgical manipulation of the surrounding bony and soft tissue elements. Preserving an intact blood supply maintains oxygen as well as the nutrients necessary to preserve cell growth, promote new blood vessel growth, and form a fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Systemic illnesses (e.g.: diabetes, chronic renal failure) can also have an adverse impact on fusion rates by impairing vascular ingrowth. Additionally, cigarette smoking, most likely as a result of the effect of nicotine on vascular supply [2], and malnutrition, are associated with a general impairment of wound healing and may also have an adverse effect on fusion healing. The type and position of spinal bone grafts affect spinal fusion. Anterior interbody (between the bone bodies) structural grafts are exposed to local compressive forces. Precise contouring and fit may affect ultimate fusion success or failure. On the contrary, a posterior applied bone graft is placed along the tension side of the spinal column. Due to the absence of local compressive stimuli, bone graft incorporation is not as directly affected by local biomechanical factors. The lack of stability of this grafting technique and the presence of excessive strain may lead to inadequate neovascularization into the graft and ultimately lack of a successful arthrodesis. Bone forming cells (osteogenesis) is an absolute requirement for a successful fusion. A patient&rsquo;s own bone (autograft) directly provides stem cells (all powerful cell lines) and bone forming cells (osteoblasts). Also, osteoinductive factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a critical role in bone formation by stimulating new cells to grow. [3].</p>\r\n\r\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin-left:30px;">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><img alt="Spinal Curves" src="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00600F01.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 181px; width: 450px;" /><br />\r\n			<span style="font-size:11px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bone is scooped out of the iliac crest&nbsp;to be used as a bone graft.</span><br />\r\n			&nbsp;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Osteoconductive substitutes (collagen, ceramics, polymers, coral, and allograft bone) may be used as scaffolds to facilitate bone formation. They provide a lattice within the developing fusion mass for new blood vessels and migrating stem cells [4]. The graft also has to be biocompatible (patient does not reject it) [5].</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Obtaining a successful spinal fusion can be extremely challenging. Careful patient selection and surgical technique are paramount and remain the most important variables in obtaining satisfactory outcomes in a majority of patients. Unfortunately, a failed spinal fusion continues to represent a considerable source of unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Using autograft bone has previously provided the most reliable means of achieving a rapid and robust fusion mass, but pain with taking one&rsquo;s own bone (harvest) has often overshadowed positive clinical results from the primary operation. Numerous alternatives to autograft bone have been developed. Some recombinant BMPs and advances in gene therapy may provide fusion enhancing capacity that matches or even exceeds the performance of autograft. The recent development of newer and more effective composite grafts has developed a new and exciting field of research in regards to biomaterials and biotechnology, promising a more effective treatment for patients requiring spinal fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="font-size:12px;"><strong>Sources:</strong><br />\r\n1) Boden SD.

Although most patients recover quickly with minimal treatment, proper evaluation is needed to identify cases of serious underlying pathology. Certain red flags should prompt aggressive treatment, whereas others are less concerning. If no red flags such as neurological deficits are present, and if the symptoms have been present for less than 8-12 weeks, most often cases are first treated with medications. Medications for acute low back pain and sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxers, oral steroids, and pain medications. This article will briefly discuss each class of medication used to treat acute low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) are often first line for acute low back pain. They reduce pain and inflammation. Examples include Motrin, Naproxen, and Lodine. Switching to a different NSAID may be considered if the first is ineffective. NSAIDs used in high doses or for extended periods of time can cause gastrointestinal problems such as gastritis or ulcers. They also should be used in caution in patients with a history of heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/getty_rf_photo_of_man_taking_medication.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non benzodiazepene muscle relaxers such as Flexeril, Robaxin, Skelaxin, and Zanaflex can be beneficial in treating low back pain that is associated with muscle spasms. Adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea. Muscle relaxants combined with NSAIDs may have additive benefit for reducing pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short dose of oral corticosteroids may be used to help treat patients with acute radicular leg pain. &nbsp;They reduce pain and inflammation much like NSAIDs. This medication is used in short intervals, usually with tapering doses such as a Medrol Dose pack. Chronic use of oral steroids for low back pain should be avoided to prevent adverse effects such as diabetes, cataracts, and osteoporosis. It is important to note that diabetics should not use oral steroids since the medication increases blood sugar. Steroids should also not be taken by patients with an active infection (e.g. sinus infection, urinary tract infection) because they can make the infection worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pain medications such as opiods are commonly used to treat severe acute low back pain, however there is little evidence of benefit over NSAIDs coupled with muscle relaxers. &nbsp;These medications should be used sparingly and on an as needed basis as they can be habit forming. Examples include codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone. Pain medications can be highly effective in treating back pain for short periods of time (less than two weeks). After the initial two weeks, the body rapidly builds a natural tolerance to narcotic medications and they lose their effectiveness to treat acute pain. While some narcotics can be used long-term to treat chronic pain, narcotics are most commonly used to treat severe acute (short-term) low back pain or post-operative pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prescription medications should always be taken as instructed by your health care provider. They should never be shared with other people and you should never take something that isn&rsquo;t prescribed to you. If you think you need treatment for back pain, call and make appointment with a health care provider today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/0414/" target="_blank">Back to the eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n', 'Medications used to Treat Acute Low Back Pain', 'medications-used-to-treat-acute-low-back-pain', '2014/04/24', '7314c78b284ad50219df8b662', 1, 7, '2014-08-28 15:37:29', '', 'meds for acute back painfe. 04242014.jpg');

First, they can be performed to diagnose the source of back, leg, neck, or arm pain (diagnostic). Second, spinal injections are used as a treatment to relieve pain (therapeutic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most spinal injections are performed as one part of a more comprehensive treatment program. Simultaneous treatment nearly always includes an exercise program to improve or maintain spinal mobility (stretching exercises) and stability (strengthening exercises).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/spine_photo1.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 378px; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Procedure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Spinal injections are performed under x-ray guidance, called fluoroscopy. This confirms correct placement of the medication and improves safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, a liquid contrast (dye) is injected before the medication. If this contrast does not flow in the correct location, the needle is repositioned and additional dye is injected until the correct flow is obtained. The medication is not injected until the correct contrast flow pattern is achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Spinal Injections</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Epidural Injections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidural injections are used to treat pain that starts in the spine and radiates to an arm or leg. Arm or leg pain often occurs when a nerve is inflamed or compressed (&quot;pinched nerve&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="width: 225px; float: right; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0 10px 10px 15px; background:#FFFFFF;"><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/Epidural_Injections.jpg" />\r\n<p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">Epidural injection in the spine.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidural injections involve injecting an anesthetic and an anti-inflammatory medication, such as a steroid (cortisone), near the affected nerve. This reduces the inflammation and lessens or resolves the pain. This type of epidural injection is a therapeutic one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For diagnostic purposes, an epidural spinal injection can be done at a very specific, isolated nerve to determine if that particular nerve is the source of pain. Sometimes only an anesthetic is injected. The immediate response to the injection is closely monitored. If the pain is completely or nearly completely relieved, then that specific nerve is the primary cause of the pain symptoms. If there is little pain relief, then another source of pain exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Facet Joint Injections</h3>\r\n\r\n<div style="width: 225px; float: right; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0 10px 10px 15px; background:#FFFFFF;"><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/Facet_Joint_Injection.jpg" />\r\n<p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">Facet joint injection in the lumber spine.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Facet joint injections can also be done for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of injections are often used when pain is caused by degenerative/arthritic conditions or injury. They are used to treat neck, middle back, or low back pain. The pain does not have to be exclusively limited to the midline spine, as these problems can cause pain to radiate into the shoulders, buttocks, or upper legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For diagnostic purposes, facet joints can be injected in two ways: injecting anesthetic directly into the joint or anesthetizing the nerves carrying the pain signals away from the joint (medial branches of the nerve). If the majority of pain is relieved with anesthetic into the joint, then a therapeutic injection of a steroid may provide lasting neck or low back pain relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="width: 225px; float: right; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0 10px 10px 15px; background:#FFFFFF;"><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/facet_joint_injection_cervical.jpg" />\r\n<p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">Facet joint injection in the cervical spine.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>anesthetizing the nerves carrying the pain signals away from the joint (medial branches of the nerve). If the majority of pain is relieved with anesthetic into the joint, then a therapeutic injection of a steroid may provide lasting neck or low back pain relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If anesthetic injections indicate that the nerve is the source of pain, the next step is to block the pain signals more permanently. This is done with radiofrequency ablation, or damaging the nerves that supply the joint with a &quot;burning&quot; technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sacroiliac Joint Injections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint (SI joint) injections are similar to facet joint injections in many ways. The SI joints are located between the sacrum and ilium (pelvic) bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Problems in the SI joints have been shown to cause pain in the low back, buttock, and leg. Typically, one joint is painful and causes pain on one side of the lower body. It is less common for both SI joints to be painful at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="width: 225px; float: right; border:1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0 10px 10px 15px;background:#FFFFFF;"><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/sacroiliac_joint.jpg" />\r\n<p style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;">Sacroiliac joint injection in the pelvis.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This joint can also be injected for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Anesthetizing the SI joint by injection under X-ray guidance is considered the gold standard for diagnosing SI joint pain. A diagnostic injection of the sacroiliac joint with anesthetic should markedly diminish the amount of pain in a specific location of the low back, buttock, or upper leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A therapeutic injection will typically include a steroid medication, with the goal of providing longer pain relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Provocation Diskography</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Provocation diskography is a type of spine injection done only for diagnosis of pain. It does not have any pain relieving effect. In fact, it is designed to try to reproduce a person&#39;s exact or typical pain. This is to find the source of longstanding back pain that does not improve with comprehensive, conservative treatment. It can severely aggravate the existing back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diskography is performed much less commonly than the other types of spinal injections reviewed above. It is often used only if surgical treatment of low back pain is being considered. The information gained from diskography can assist in planning the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diskography involves stimulating and &quot;pressurizing&quot; an intervertebral disk by injecting a liquid into the jelly-like center (nucleus pulposus) of the disk. More than one disk is injected in order to distinguish a problem disk from one without symptoms. Criteria are used to identify a painful disk by provocation discography, including the type and location of pain and the appearance of the disk on an X-ray after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Complications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Spinal injection procedures are generally safe procedures. If complications occur, they are usually mild and self-limited. The risks of spinal injections include, but are not limited to the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Bleeding</li>\r\n	<li>Infection</li>\r\n	<li>Nerve injury</li>\r\n	<li>Arachnoiditis</li>\r\n	<li>Paralysis</li>\r\n	<li>Avascular necrosis</li>\r\n	<li>Spinal headache</li>\r\n	<li>Muscle weakness</li>\r\n	<li>Increased pain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Common side effects from steroids include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Facial flushing</li>\r\n	<li>Increased appetite</li>\r\n	<li>Menstrual irregularities</li>\r\n	<li>Nausea</li>\r\n	<li>Diarrhea</li>\r\n	<li>Increased blood sugar</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people are not good candidates for spinal injections. These include people with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Skin infection at the site of needle puncture</li>\r\n	<li>Bleeding disorder or anticoagulation</li>\r\n	<li>Uncontrolled high blood pressure or diabetes</li>\r\n	<li>Allergy to contrast, anesthetics, or steroids<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/0714/" target="_blank">Back to the eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org" target="_blank">Read the article on aaos.org</a></p>\r\n', 'Spinal Injections', 'spinal-injections', '2014/07/25', 'cdc3bb68827afeeb105560ca4', 1, 2, '2014-08-28 15:38:26', '', 'spine injections fe. 07252014.jpg');

Most people involved in a minor motor vehicle accident recover quickly without any chronic symptoms. In whiplash, the spines intervertebral joints, discs, ligaments, muscles, and nerve roots may become damaged. Symptoms include neck pain and stiffness, headaches, pain in the shoulders or shoulder blades, low back pain, dizziness, fatigue and sleep disturbances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">In most cases whiplash is diagnosed by a thorough history and physical by a physician. X-rays cannot show damage to soft tissues such as the </span>discs<span style="line-height: 1.6;">, muscles, and ligaments, but may be taken to assess for fracture. Often, if neck pain continues despite conservative treatment, a CT or MRI may be required for further evaluation of the soft tissues.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whiplash injuries are treated with pain relief medications such as NSAIDS like ibuprofen and naproxen. Other treatment includes gentle exercises, physical therapy, traction, massage, heat, ice and injections. Physical therapy can help strengthen muscles and reduce painful motions. In the past, whiplash was often treated with cervical immobilization, however it is now believed early movement is beneficial. &nbsp;Cervical collars and immobilization may cause muscle atrophy (muscle wasting), decrease blood flow to the injured tissues, and cause greater chances of chronic symptoms.

When the space becomes smaller, the disc tends to bulge out or herniate causing the nerve roots to become pinched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the neck, symptoms of Degenerative Disc&nbsp;Disease are neck pain and stiffness.&nbsp;If there is pressure on the nerve from a disc, it can also cause pain, numbness, or weakness radiating down your shoulder, arm, and hand.&nbsp;Common tests to look at this process are Xrays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="/images/uploads/DDD2_%281%29.jpg" style="margin: 5px 0px 10px 20px; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); border-image: none; width: 250px; height: 206px; float: right;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several lines of treatment for Degenerative Disc&nbsp;Disease.&nbsp; The first line of treatment is over the counter medications including Tylenol and NSAIDs such as Advil.&nbsp; If these medications aren&rsquo;t helping with pain then the next line of treatment may include steroids and/or narcotics.&nbsp;Another line of treatment is physical therapy and a home exercise program. A therapist can perform treatment such as traction, manipulations, and exercises/stretches helping with pain and range of motion. If the neck symptoms do not improve with conservative treatment, other lines of treatment are epidural steroid injections and surgery. If someone has significant numbness or weakness then surgery becomes a treatment option.&nbsp; The primary surgery for DDD is called a discectomy.&nbsp; After the physician performs the discectomy, then it is followed with an artificial disc replacement or cervical fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Degenerative Disc&nbsp;Disease is most commonly often due to age, but can be influenced by lifestyle factors. Ways to promote better spine health include eating a balance diet and exercising regularly. Smoking is a risk factor for Degenerative Disc&nbsp;Disease.

INSERT INTO `blogPosts` VALUES (28, 'Meegan Domangue, PA-C', 'mdomangue@spinecenterbr.com', '<p>Low Back Pain is an extremely common condition affecting 4 out of 5 people at some point in their adult life. The natural aging process of the spine leads to degeneration of the spinal integrity. In severe cases this leads to debilitating pain and discomfort. An understanding of pain generators is easier with a brief understanding of the spinal anatomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/Spine-Center_anatomy-pic-revised_121014.jpg" style="width: 290px; height: 280px; float: right; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: -20px;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your spine is composed of 24 bones called vertebrae. These are divided into 3 sections: cervical (neck), thoracic (mid back), and lumbar (lower back). The base of the spine is a section known as the sacral region. Between each bone is soft tissue known as the disc. The disc acts as a shock absorber for the bones allowing the spine to bend and move. Encased by your vertebrae are your spinal cord and nerve roots. Along the back of your spine under the surface of your skin are small bony protuberances called spinous processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One specific condition resulting from deterioration of the spine is called spinal stenosis. This results in the nerves around the spine becoming pinched. This leads to symptoms which can include low back pain, shooting or burning pain in the legs, weakness in the legs or feet, numbness and tingling in the legs and decreased range of motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In certain cases the symptoms of stenosis persist despite conservative treatment with medications, physical therapy, activity modification, and steroid injections. At this point surgical options may be recommended. Generally, surgery would consist of fusion and/or decompression. During this procedure, spinal vertebrae are fused together, usually with the aid of implanted hardware, to restrict motion in the spine and decrease pain. In a traditional fusion, larger incisions are made resulting in more muscle disruption, blood loss and longer postoperative recovery. A simpler alternative may be available in the form of a minimally invasive interspinous decompression system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/interspinous-implant-with-caption.jpg" style="width: 190px; height: 300px; float: left; border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 5px;" />For patients who are specifically interested in a &ldquo;smaller surgery,&rdquo; or elderly patients who would not be a candidate for a more complex surgery with longer anesthesia time, this may be an alternative. The interspinous device is typically a small titanium implant that attaches between the spinous process. The disc remains in place and decompression occurs from the additional space created by the interspinous implant. This leads to less pain and quicker recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typical presentation of a patient that is an ideal candidate is one complaining of back AND buttock or leg pain. The pain is generally worse standing and walking. A necessary component of the pain is that it is adequately relieved if the patient sits down or leans forward. An example is the patient that has to rest forward on the shopping cart while walking in a grocery store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, a formal evaluation and adequate testing can be performed to assess your condition. Different options from conservative measures to surgical options can be discussed and implemented based on your comfort level.

Compared to an adult, a child with a backache is more likely to have a serious underlying disorder. This is especially true if the child is 4 years old or younger or if a child of any age has back pain accompanied by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fever or weight loss</li>\r\n	<li>Weakness or numbness</li>\r\n	<li>Trouble walking</li>\r\n	<li>Pain that radiates down one or both legs</li>\r\n	<li>Bowel or bladder problems</li>\r\n	<li>Pain that keeps the child from sleeping</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>More serious causes of back pain need early identification and treatment or they may become worse. Always see a doctor if your young child&#39;s back pain lasts for more than several days or progressively worsens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Doctor Examination</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will begin by learning about how the problem developed. Then, he or she will conduct a physical examination of your child.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Medical History/Symptoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will ask general questions about your child&#39;s overall health and more specific questions about the pain. The questions and physical examination will allow your doctor to determine which of a number of conditions is responsible for your child&#39;s back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will want to know when the pain began, if it was associated with injury or demanding activity, and whether it has improved or worsened. He or she will ask if there is anything that makes it worse, and what your child does to make it less painful. It will be important for your doctor to know exactly where the pain is felt, how severe it is, and how much it interferes with the child&#39;s schooling and activities. If the pain shoots into a leg it could mean that there is pressure on a nerve.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Physical Examination</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the physical examination of your child, your doctor carefully examines the muscles, bones, and nerves. Your doctor will be checking the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The spine.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor feels each vertebra and looks for deformities in the alignment and mobility of the spine. Increased roundness of the back or a curve to the side could be important. Your doctor will check posture and walking gait; the ability to bend over to touch the toes; and bending to the right and left. Difficulty with movement may indicate that there is a problem with the joints of the spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Nerves in the back.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Disk problems can cause pressure on the nerves that exit the spine, so your doctor will perform specific tests for that. With your child lying face up, your doctor will raise the legs (straight leg raising test) and may also raise the legs with your child lying face down (reverse straight leg raising test). Testing reflexes and feeling in the legs will be done for the same reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Muscles.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The muscles in the back and legs are tested. Tightness of the back muscles or the hamstring muscles at the back of the thigh will show that your child is trying to protect himself or herself from movements and positions that might be painful. Tenderness of the muscles will indicate a muscle injury, such as a strain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Balance, flexibility, coordination, and muscle strength.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Other tests will be done to be sure the back pain is not part of a bigger picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nInvestigations/Tests</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Imaging Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctor may use one or several diagnostic imaging tools to see inside the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>X-rays.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>X-rays of the spine will show the bones and may show fractures, displacements, or other problems within the bones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Bone scans.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This test involves injecting a substance into a vein and then using a special camera to see where it is picked up. It can pinpoint inflammation, infections, tumors, and fractures. Since the anatomy of the spine is very complicated and since these processes are not always visible on x-ray, the bone scan can be very useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Computed tomography (CT) scans.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a special computerized x-ray technique that provides a three-dimensional image and allows your doctor to see things that are not visible on two-dimensional x-rays. It is particularly useful in the spine to understand the complex anatomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This technique is very valuable because it shows tissues other than bone. It can be used to see the spinal cord, nerve roots, disks, or other soft tissues than can be very important in back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Laboratory Tests</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Blood tests, including the complete blood-cell count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), can all be changed in the presence of inflammation or infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nCommon Back Pain Conditions in Children</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Muscle Strain and Imbalances</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Musculoskeletal strain is most often responsible for back pain in children and adolescents. This type of pain frequently responds to rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and an exercise program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many teenagers may have more persistent back pain. This is often related to tight hamstring muscles and weak abdominal muscles. These children seem to improve with a physical therapy program that stresses hamstring stretching and abdominal strengthening.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rounded Back</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="/images/uploads/round-shoulders1.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 200px; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px; float: right;" />In adolescents, rounded back, also called Scheuermann&#39;s kyphosis, is a common cause of pain in the middle of the back (the thoracic spine). Vertebrae become wedged, causing a rounded, or hunched, back. The curved part of the back may ache and pain may get worse with activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An adolescent male presents with excessive roundback localized to the thoracic spine. The severe kyphosis is most obvious when he bends forward.<br />\r\n(Courtesy of Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stress Fracture of the Spine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Spondylolysis, or stress fracture, may cause lower back pain in adolescents. Stress fractures may occur during adolescent growth spurts or in sports that repeatedly twist and hyperextend the spine, like gymnastics, diving, and football.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pain is usually mild and may radiate to the buttocks and legs. The pain feels worse with activity and better with rest. A child with spondylolysis may walk with a stiff legged gait and only be able to take short steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Slipped Vertebra</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this drawing of spondylolisthesis, a lower back vertebra has shifted forward. <img src="/images/uploads/A00036F02.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 247px; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px; float: right;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A slipped vertebra, or spondylolisthesis, occurs when one vertebra shifts forward on the next vertebra directly below. It usually occurs at the base of the spine (lumbosacral junction). In severe cases, the bone narrows the spinal canal, which presses on the nerves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Infection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In young children, infection in a disk space (diskitis) can lead to back pain. Diskitis typically affects children between the ages of 1 and 5 years, although older children and teenagers can also be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A child with diskitis may have the following symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pain in the lower back or abdomen and stiffness of the spine</li>\r\n	<li>Walking with a limp, or simply refusing to walk</li>\r\n	<li>Squatting with a straight spine when reaching for something on the floor, rather than bending from the waist</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tumor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On rare occasion, tumors, such as osteoid osteoma, can be responsible for back pain. When they occur, tumors of the spine are most often found in the middle or lower back. Pain is constant and usually becomes worse over time. This pain is progressive; it is unrelated to activity and/or happens at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/newsletter/1114" target="_blank">Back to eNewsletter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.79px;"><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00036" target="_blank">Read the article on aaos.org</a></p>', 'Back Pain in Children', 'back-pain-in-children', '2014/11/12', '7063335f18c064aae19751516', 1, 3, '2014-11-12 16:09:15', '', 'kid-back-pain-300x200.jpg');

This by itself is thought to be able to produce joint pain, but could also irritate surrounding nerves that cause additional pain.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (5, 10, '<h2>Endoscopic Rhizotomy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The facet joints of the lumbar spine are responsible for controlling motion and providing stability to the lower back. These small articulations can develop arthritis and inflammation similar to the hip, knee and other larger joints in the body. The facets are thought to be responsible for low back pain in up to 40% of cases. The facet joints are innervated by a small medial branch of the spinal nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmitting the sensation of pain from the facet back to the brain. In patients with suspected facet related pain, the medial branch has historically been targeted with a rhizotomy. This procedure has been classically done by pain management doctors. A probe is inserted percutaneously with X-ray guidance to the area where the nerve is thought to be located based on anatomic relationships. The probe is then heated and wanded back and forth with the hope of ablating the nerve and relieving the pain. However, this blind technique can have its limitations and failures, and recurrence rates can be high. When this procedure is successful, patients can experience relief of their lower back pain up to 12-18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Endoscopic Rhizotomy" src="http://boneandjointclinicbr.com/newsletter/080712/images/rhizotomy-2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; float:right; margin: 0 0 15px 20px;" />The Spine Center at the Bone and Joint Clinic of Baton Rouge has been performing a new and innovative procedure for facet related back pain. Patients are diagnosed with this condition through a physical examination, radiographic studies and a confirmatory medial branch block injection. Appropriate patients are considered for the endoscopically assisted medial branch rhizotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this procedure, an endoscope is inserted percutaneously and the medial branch nerve is located with direct visualization. The endoscope has a unique working channel through which special instruments such as a laser or radiofrequency probe can be inserted. Using these instruments, the medial branch nerve can then be ablated under direct visualization. It is theorized that this procedure will allow more accurate targeting of this nerve and thus more predictable and lasting results than the more common blind medial branch rhizotomy. This procedure has been performed with great success at the Bone and Joint Clinic since 2009. The Spine Center is currently enrolling patients in a clinical study to collect comparative data on the effectiveness of this new technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n', '2014-07-16 11:16:18');

The Spine Center team is engaged in clinical studies testing the effectiveness and safety of new devices and procedures in addition to studies that seek to expand the scientific and medical knowledge of existing procedures. Patients at the Spine Center have the opportunity to contribute to our research process by participating in one of our clinical trials. Please see below for more information on our currently available studies. Forms in this section require <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">Adobe Reader</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequently asked questions about Clinical Research</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a clinical research study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.Â  Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patientsâ€™ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physiciansâ€™ recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.Â Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is required of a patient in a research study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.Â  All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why should I participate?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study. The study staff is an added resource; we are available to address any questions or concerns and coordinate all study activities. We carefully monitor research participants before and after surgery.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (110, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (12, 8, '<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. McCarthy and the Spine Center team are dedicated to the discovery of new ways to diagnose and treat spinal injuries and disorders. The Spine Center team is engaged in clinical studies testing the effectiveness and safety of new devices and procedures in addition to studies that seek to expand the scientific and medical knowledge of existing procedures. Patients at the Spine Center have the opportunity to contribute to our research process by participating in one of our clinical trials. Please see below for more information on our currently available studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a clinical research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.Â  Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patientsâ€™ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physiciansâ€™ recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.Â Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is required of a patient in a research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.Â  All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom Line: Why should I participate?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (150, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name="ifuse"></a><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/education-resources/spine-articles/view/minimally-invasive-vs-traditional-open-spine-surgery-explained/" target="_blank">here </a>to read an article about Minimally Invasive vs. Traditional Open Spine Surgey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treatment Options for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatments can vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and how much they limit your everyday activities. Below are some of the treatment options you may want to discuss with your doctor, depending on your symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nonsurgical Treatment for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first line of treatment, your doctor may prescribe any one or more of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.</li>\r\n	<li>Physical therapy can help provide strengthening and pelvic stabilization exercises to reduce the movement in the SI joint.</li>\r\n	<li>SI belt wraps around the hips to help squeeze the sacroiliac joints together. This supports and stabilizes the pelvis and sacroiliac joints.</li>\r\n	<li>SI joint injections can reduce inflammation and relieve the pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If symptoms persist due to instability, your physician may recommendÂ <a href="/spine-procedures/ifuse-implant-system/">stabilizing your joint with sacroiliac joint fusion</a>.</p>', '2014-12-11 16:34:42');

The Spine Center team is engaged in clinical studies testing the effectiveness and safety of new devices and procedures in addition to studies that seek to expand the scientific and medical knowledge of existing procedures. Patients at the Spine Center have the opportunity to contribute to our research process by participating in one of our clinical trials. Please see below for more information on our currently available studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a clinical research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.Â  Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patientsâ€™ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physiciansâ€™ recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.Â Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is required of a patient in a research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.Â  All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom Line: Why should I participate?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study. The study staff is an added resource; we are available to address any questions or concerns and coordinate all study activities. We carefully monitor research participants before and after surgery.

There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>iFuse Implant System</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System is a minimally invasive option for patients suffering from sacroiliac joint disorders, including SI joint disruptions and degenerative sacroiliitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse procedure takes about an hour and involves three small titanium implants inserted surgically across the sacroiliac joint. The entire procedure is done through a small incision, with no soft tissue stripping and minimal tendon irritation. Patients may leave the hospital the next day after surgery and can usually resume daily living activities within six weeks, depending on how well they are healing and based on physicianâ€™s orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse procedure offers several benefits compared to traditional sacroiliac joint surgery:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Minimal incision size</li>\r\n	<li>Immediate post-operative stabilization</li>\r\n	<li>Minimal soft tissue stripping</li>\r\n	<li>Potential of a quicker recovery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="action-btn" href="/spine-procedures/ifuse-implant-system/">Learn More</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day.

A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name="ifuse"></a><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (57, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n<script

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (65, 8, '<p><em>Dr. McCarthy and the Spine Center team are dedicated to the discovery of new ways to diagnose and treat spinal injuries and disorders. The Spine Center team is engaged in clinical studies testing the effectiveness and safety of new devices and procedures in addition to studies that seek to expand the scientific and medical knowledge of existing procedures. Patients at the Spine Center have the opportunity to contribute to our research process by participating in one of our clinical trials. Please see below for more information on our currently available studies.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a clinical research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.Â  Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patientsâ€™ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physiciansâ€™ recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.Â Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is required of a patient in a research study?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.Â  All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottom Line: Why should I participate?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study. The study staff is an added resource; we are available to address any questions or concerns and coordinate all study activities. We carefully monitor research participants before and after surgery. Would you like to contribute to advancing treatments for spine care? Learn more about the current research studies at the Spine Center below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAMP Study</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>"Prospective, Multicenter Clinical Study Comparing Axial Lumbar Interbody Fusion (AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup>) and Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) Spinal Procedures"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this study is to compare two surgical options that fuse the spine: AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup> (axial lumbar interbody fusion) and TLIF (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion). Both AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup> and TLIF have been cleared for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and will be used according to approved guidelines. This means that both AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup> and TLIF are already available to patients on the commercial market, and neither procedure is considered experimental. Read more about <a href="/spine-procedures/axial-lif">AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup></a> and <a href="/spine-procedures/minimally-invasive-tlif/ ">TLIF</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are eligible and you decide to participate in this study, you will be randomized to receive an AxiaLIF<sup>Â®</sup> or a TLIF surgery. You will be in the study for about 24 months. There will be about 200 subjects from approximately 15 clinic sites in the United States in this study. Make an appointment at the Spine Center to determine if you are eligible to participate in this study.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate improvement in low back pain and function after this procedure.

Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patientsâ€™ experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care.

This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (80, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day.

A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a

They are licensed to evaluate patients independently, order diagnostic testing, diagnose, and establish treatment plans under the supervision of a collaborating physician. You may see a PA/NP without seeing the doctor, but the physician always reviews and approves any treatment protocols. PAâ€™s and NPâ€™s have prescriptive authority to prescribe and renew medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it necessary to bring reports, previous X-rays and/or MRI films to my first appointment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all very important diagnostic tools and can be helpful for the physician to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can I tell if my child has scoliosis, and does it cause any problems?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at your childâ€™s spine to see if it curves. Also, check to see if one shoulder is lower than the other. Your doctor can also check by looking at your childâ€™s stance and ordering an X-ray for a definitive diagnosis. In most people, the curve in the spine is so small it causes no problems. In severe cases, the curve may cause back pain and restrict the amount of space available for the lungs and heart to work properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If my spine is fused, will I have limitation in my motion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of cases, patients are left with no significant decrease in motion. One and two level neck and back fusions rarely result in any limitation of â€œfunctionalâ€ motion. Some patients may notice a slight difference in full motion, but this usually does not affect most activities of daily living. Larger fusions involving three or more motion segments may result in a noticeable difference in some activities, but this is usually not debilitating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will I need to wear a back or neck brace after my surgery and for how long?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This obviously differs with each of the types of surgeries we perform. For lower back fusions, patients typically stay in a stiff/rigid brace for six weeks, then transition into a softer brace for another four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For neck fusions, there is usually more variation in how long bracing is used. This ordinarily depends on how many levels are fused and the patientâ€™s bone quality. Most patients wear a stiff/rigid collar anywhere from two to six weeks, then a softer collar for another three to four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patientâ€™s undergoing non-fusion surgery, such as a microdiscectomy, typically wear a soft brace or corset brace for six weeks after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When can I return to work after my surgery?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This varies significantly from patient to patient. We take into account the type of surgery performed, the patientâ€™s line of work, and their post-operative recovery when making this decision. In general, patients who perform sedentary work can return to work as soon as one to two weeks after surgery. Patients who perform heavy-demand work are generally out for a minimum of six weeks. Again, there is no one recommendation; therefore, we suggest you further discuss this during the surgical-planning phase of your care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When will I notice relief in my back or leg following an epidural steroid injection (ESI)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most commonly, pain relief is noticed within 24 to 48 hours. Some patients respond slower and get results within 1 to 2 weeks. Maximum benefit is usually seen by 2 weeks post-procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long will my ESI last?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is extremely variable from patient to patient. Some patients receive 1 or up to 3 injections with relief lasting from weeks to years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the risks and side effects associated with ESIâ€™s?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ESI is one of the safest procedures performed in medicine today. The overall complication rate is far less than one percent. Nonetheless, there is some expectation of risk with any medical procedure. We take numerous precautions to prevent any problems and strongly recommend that all patients fully review their pre-injection instructions. Most complications arise from patients not following these instructions. The primary procedure risks involve bleeding, infection, spinal fluid leakage, and injury to nerve structures. Secondary risks involve the potential side effects of the medications used during the procedure (from the steroid itself). These include temporary weight gain, increase in blood sugar (mainly in diabetics), water retention, and suppression of the bodyâ€™s own natural production of similar steroids. Long-term effects of chronic steroid use include thinning of the bones, early cataract formation, and avascular necrosis (a condition involving decreased blood supply to the hip bone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What should I do after my ESI? Can I return to work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise patients to take it easy for a day or so after the procedure. Afterward, patients are allowed to resume normal activities as tolerated. Most patients have no problem returning to work one or two days after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What should I expect to feel after an ESI?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the injection, some patients may feel a heaviness or numbness in the legs. This is an expected effect of the numbing agent and usually goes away after several hours. Most patients generally experience a â€œsore backâ€ for a day or two afterward. The full effect of the steroid medication usually takes 24 to 48 hours to begin working. Some patients have a longer period until they feel relief. It is not uncommon for many patients to feel relief for only a week or so after a first injection; this usually will result in long-term pain relief after a repeated injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the advantages of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) compared to traditional open surgery?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures typically involve less destruction of normal tissues during surgery. In a traditional open procedure, a wide area of normal tissues (muscles, ligaments and bone structures) are sacrificed during the surgical exposure. These structures typically never return to normal function and will eventually form a large mass of scar that may later cause pain, spasm and dysfunction. During a minimally invasive surgery, special equipment and techniques are employed that allow for the same surgery to be performed with significantly less surgical morbidity. In addition, patients usually have less blood-loss, require shorter hospital stays and encounter less post-operative complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the advantages of endoscopic surgery?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes referred to as â€˜laserâ€™ surgery, endoscopic spine surgery is a newer type of minimally invasive spine procedure offered today. During this type of surgery, a small camera is used. This allows for better and more accurate visualization of the areas being targeted. The major advantage of these procedures is that a very small area of normal tissue is disrupted during the surgery. As a result, most patients experience very little pain and have a minimal amount of blood-loss. In addition, this is almost always an outpatient procedure. We offer several different types of endoscopic procedures depending on the patients specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will I need to go to Physical Therapy after my surgery?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of surgeries we perform the only physical therapy needed is for transfers and progressive ambulation. In most cases, this is performed during a patients hospital stay and most people donâ€™t require additional visits with a therapist. Occasionally, some patients may require physical therapy via a home-health agency â€“ the decision for this is made at time of discharge. Following some lumbar procedures, some people benefit greatly from pool-therapy. This is usually evaluated and decided upon during post-operative office visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many patients overlook the role of physical therapy prior to surgery. This often occurs as some people may have had a negative experience with physical therapy in the past. Ideally, pre-operative physical therapy should be targeted to strengthen and condition muscles that support and surround the spine. The stronger these muscles are prior to surgery, the quicker they will rebound afterward. Conversely, weaker muscles will generally require more time and conditioning to return to normal function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is facet pain?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Lumbar Facet Syndrome, facet pain refers to pain that is generated by the small joints that form the spinal column. These joints fall victim to degenerative changes (arthritis) in all humans. Many people are lucky and only experience minimal or no pain from this natural process. Other people can experience severe symptoms resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most patients note early morning low back pain that improves after they begin moving around. Pain sometimes returns after one has been idle for a while. This pain usually worsens with extension of the lumbar spine - when the spine is stretched and arched backwards (i.e. shoulders back). A Medial Branch Block or Facet Injection is a procedure that helps to diagnose this pain. Many patients with facet pain improve with medications, physical therapy and activity modification. Some patients may require injections and/or surgery depending on their level of disability. The Endoscopic Rhizotomy procedure is extremely effective in providing long-term pain relief from this problem.</p>\r\n', '2014-09-05 15:47:34');

These include temporary weight gain, increase in blood sugar (mainly in diabetics), water retention, and suppression of the bodyâ€™s own natural production of similar steroids. Long-term effects of chronic steroid use include thinning of the bones, early cataract formation, and avascular necrosis (a condition involving decreased blood supply to the hip bone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should I do after my ESI? Can I return to work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise patients to take it easy for a day or so after the procedure. Afterward, patients are allowed to resume normal activities as tolerated. Most patients have no problem returning to work one or two days after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should I expect to feel after an ESI?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the injection, some patients may feel a heaviness or numbness in the legs. This is an expected effect of the numbing agent and usually goes away after several hours. Most patients generally experience a â€œsore backâ€ for a day or two afterward. The full effect of the steroid medication usually takes 24 to 48 hours to begin working. Some patients have a longer period until they feel relief. It is not uncommon for many patients to feel relief for only a week or so after a first injection; this usually will result in long-term pain relief after a repeated injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the advantages of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) compared to traditional open surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures typically involve less destruction of normal tissues during surgery. In a traditional open procedure, a wide area of normal tissues (muscles, ligaments and bone structures) are sacrificed during the surgical exposure. These structures typically never return to normal function and will eventually form a large mass of scar that may later cause pain, spasm and dysfunction. During a minimally invasive surgery, special equipment and techniques are employed that allow for the same surgery to be performed with significantly less surgical morbidity. In addition, patients usually have less blood-loss, require shorter hospital stays and encounter less post-operative complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the advantages of endoscopic surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes referred to as â€˜laserâ€™ surgery, endoscopic spine surgery is a newer type of minimally invasive spine procedure offered today. During this type of surgery, a small camera is used. This allows for better and more accurate visualization of the areas being targeted. The major advantage of these procedures is that a very small area of normal tissue is disrupted during the surgery. As a result, most patients experience very little pain and have a minimal amount of blood-loss. In addition, this is almost always an outpatient procedure. We offer several different types of endoscopic procedures depending on the patients specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I need to go to Physical Therapy after my surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of surgeries we perform the only physical therapy needed is for transfers and progressive ambulation. In most cases, this is performed during a patients hospital stay and most people donâ€™t require additional visits with a therapist. Occasionally, some patients may require physical therapy via a home-health agency â€“ the decision for this is made at time of discharge. Following some lumbar procedures, some people benefit greatly from pool-therapy. This is usually evaluated and decided upon during post-operative office visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many patients overlook the role of physical therapy prior to surgery. This often occurs as some people may have had a negative experience with physical therapy in the past. Ideally, pre-operative physical therapy should be targeted to strengthen and condition muscles that support and surround the spine. The stronger these muscles are prior to surgery, the quicker they will rebound afterward. Conversely, weaker muscles will generally require more time and conditioning to return to normal function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is facet pain?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Lumbar Facet Syndrome, facet pain refers to pain that is generated by the small joints that form the spinal column. These joints fall victim to degenerative changes (arthritis) in all humans. Many people are lucky and only experience minimal or no pain from this natural process. Other people can experience severe symptoms resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most patients note early morning low back pain that improves after they begin moving around. Pain sometimes returns after one has been idle for a while. This pain usually worsens with extension of the lumbar spine - when the spine is stretched and arched backwards (i.e. shoulders back). A Medial Branch Block or Facet Injection is a procedure that helps to diagnose this pain. Many patients with facet pain improve with medications, physical therapy and activity modification. Some patients may require injections and/or surgery depending on their level of disability. The Endoscopic Rhizotomy procedure is extremely effective in providing long-term pain relief from this problem.</p>\r\n', '2014-09-05 15:49:43');

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (97, 22, '<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don''t see the answer to your question below,Â <a href="mailto:info@spinecenterbr.com">email us</a> and one of our helpful staff will get back with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a Physician Assistant and/or Nurse Practitioner, and can I see one when the doctor is out?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners are mid-level providers. They are licensed to evaluate patients independently, order diagnostic testing, diagnose, and establish treatment plans under the supervision of a collaborating physician. You may see a PA/NP without seeing the doctor, but the physician always reviews and approves any treatment protocols. PAâ€™s and NPâ€™s have prescriptive authority to prescribe and renew medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it necessary to bring reports, previous X-rays and/or MRI films to my first appointment?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all very important diagnostic tools and can be helpful for the physician to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can I tell if my child has scoliosis, and does it cause any problems?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at your childâ€™s spine to see if it curves. Also, check to see if one shoulder is lower than the other. Your doctor can also check by looking at your childâ€™s stance and ordering an X-ray for a definitive diagnosis. In most people, the curve in the spine is so small it causes no problems. In severe cases, the curve may cause back pain and restrict the amount of space available for the lungs and heart to work properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If my spine is fused, will I have limitation in my motion?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of cases, patients are left with no significant decrease in motion. One and two level neck and back fusions rarely result in any limitation of â€œfunctionalâ€ motion. Some patients may notice a slight difference in full motion, but this usually does not affect most activities of daily living. Larger fusions involving three or more motion segments may result in a noticeable difference in some activities, but this is usually not debilitating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I need to wear a back or neck brace after my surgery and for how long?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This obviously differs with each of the types of surgeries we perform. For lower back fusions, patients typically stay in a stiff/rigid brace for six weeks, then transition into a softer brace for another four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For neck fusions, there is usually more variation in how long bracing is used. This ordinarily depends on how many levels are fused and the patientâ€™s bone quality. Most patients wear a stiff/rigid collar anywhere from two to six weeks, then a softer collar for another three to four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patientâ€™s undergoing non-fusion surgery, such as a microdiscectomy, typically wear a soft brace or corset brace for six weeks after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When can I return to work after my surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This varies significantly from patient to patient. We take into account the type of surgery performed, the patientâ€™s line of work, and their post-operative recovery when making this decision. In general, patients who perform sedentary work can return to work as soon as one to two weeks after surgery. Patients who perform heavy-demand work are generally out for a minimum of six weeks. Again, there is no one recommendation; therefore, we suggest you further discuss this during the surgical-planning phase of your care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When will I notice relief in my back or leg following an epidural steroid injection (ESI)?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most commonly, pain relief is noticed within 24 to 48 hours. Some patients respond slower and get results within 1 to 2 weeks. Maximum benefit is usually seen by 2 weeks post-procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long will my ESI last?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is extremely variable from patient to patient. Some patients receive 1 or up to 3 injections with relief lasting from weeks to years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the risks and side effects associated with ESIâ€™s?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ESI is one of the safest procedures performed in medicine today. The overall complication rate is far less than one percent. Nonetheless, there is some expectation of risk with any medical procedure. We take numerous precautions to prevent any problems and strongly recommend that all patients fully review their pre-injection instructions. Most complications arise from patients not following these instructions. The primary procedure risks involve bleeding, infection, spinal fluid leakage, and injury to nerve structures. Secondary risks involve the potential side effects of the medications used during the procedure (from the steroid itself). These include temporary weight gain, increase in blood sugar (mainly in diabetics), water retention, and suppression of the bodyâ€™s own natural production of similar steroids. Long-term effects of chronic steroid use include thinning of the bones, early cataract formation, and avascular necrosis (a condition involving decreased blood supply to the hip bone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should I do after my ESI? Can I return to work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise patients to take it easy for a day or so after the procedure. Afterward, patients are allowed to resume normal activities as tolerated. Most patients have no problem returning to work one or two days after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should I expect to feel after an ESI?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the injection, some patients may feel a heaviness or numbness in the legs. This is an expected effect of the numbing agent and usually goes away after several hours. Most patients generally experience a â€œsore backâ€ for a day or two afterward. The full effect of the steroid medication usually takes 24 to 48 hours to begin working. Some patients have a longer period until they feel relief. It is not uncommon for many patients to feel relief for only a week or so after a first injection; this usually will result in long-term pain relief after a repeated injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the advantages of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) compared to traditional open surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures typically involve less destruction of normal tissues during surgery. In a traditional open procedure, a wide area of normal tissues (muscles, ligaments and bone structures) are sacrificed during the surgical exposure. These structures typically never return to normal function and will eventually form a large mass of scar that may later cause pain, spasm and dysfunction. During a minimally invasive surgery, special equipment and techniques are employed that allow for the same surgery to be performed with significantly less surgical morbidity. In addition, patients usually have less blood-loss, require shorter hospital stays and encounter less post-operative complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the advantages of endoscopic surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes referred to as â€˜laserâ€™ surgery, endoscopic spine surgery is a newer type of minimally invasive spine procedure offered today. During this type of surgery, a small camera is used. This allows for better and more accurate visualization of the areas being targeted. The major advantage of these procedures is that a very small area of normal tissue is disrupted during the surgery. As a result, most patients experience very little pain and have a minimal amount of blood-loss. In addition, this is almost always an outpatient procedure. We offer several different types of endoscopic procedures depending on the patients specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I need to go to Physical Therapy after my surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of surgeries we perform the only physical therapy needed is for transfers and progressive ambulation. In most cases, this is performed during a patients hospital stay and most people donâ€™t require additional visits with a therapist. Occasionally, some patients may require physical therapy via a home-health agency â€“ the decision for this is made at time of discharge. Following some lumbar procedures, some people benefit greatly from pool-therapy. This is usually evaluated and decided upon during post-operative office visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many patients overlook the role of physical therapy prior to surgery. This often occurs as some people may have had a negative experience with physical therapy in the past. Ideally, pre-operative physical therapy should be targeted to strengthen and condition muscles that support and surround the spine. The stronger these muscles are prior to surgery, the quicker they will rebound afterward. Conversely, weaker muscles will generally require more time and conditioning to return to normal function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is facet pain?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Lumbar Facet Syndrome, facet pain refers to pain that is generated by the small joints that form the spinal column. These joints fall victim to degenerative changes (arthritis) in all humans. Many people are lucky and only experience minimal or no pain from this natural process. Other people can experience severe symptoms resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most patients note early morning low back pain that improves after they begin moving around. Pain sometimes returns after one has been idle for a while. This pain usually worsens with extension of the lumbar spine - when the spine is stretched and arched backwards (i.e. shoulders back). A Medial Branch Block or Facet Injection is a procedure that helps to diagnose this pain. Many patients with facet pain improve with medications, physical therapy and activity modification. Some patients may require injections and/or surgery depending on their level of disability. The Endoscopic Rhizotomy procedure is extremely effective in providing long-term pain relief from this problem.</p>\r\n', '2014-09-08 12:21:49');

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (111, 10, '<h2>Endoscopic Rhizotomy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The facet joints of the lumbar spine are responsible for controlling motion and providing stability to the lower back. These small articulations can develop arthritis and inflammation similar to the hip, knee and other larger joints in the body. The facets are thought to be responsible for low back pain in up to 40% of cases. The facet joints are innervated by a small medial branch of the spinal nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmitting the sensation of pain from the facet back to the brain. In patients with suspected facet related pain, the medial branch has historically been targeted with a rhizotomy. This procedure has been classically done by pain management doctors. A probe is inserted percutaneously with X-ray guidance to the area where the nerve is thought to be located based on anatomic relationships. The probe is then heated and wanded back and forth with the hope of ablating the nerve and relieving the pain. However, this blind technique can have its limitations and failures, and recurrence rates can be high. When this procedure is successful, patients can experience relief of their lower back pain up to 12-18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Endoscopic Rhizotomy" src="http://boneandjointclinicbr.com/newsletter/080712/images/rhizotomy-2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; float:right; margin: 0 0 15px 20px;" />The Spine Center at the Bone and Joint Clinic of Baton Rouge has been performing a new and innovative procedure for facet related back pain. Patients are diagnosed with this condition through a physical examination, radiographic studies and a confirmatory medial branch block injection. Appropriate patients are considered for the endoscopically assisted medial branch rhizotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this procedure, an endoscope is inserted percutaneously and the medial branch nerve is located with direct visualization. The endoscope has a unique working channel through which special instruments such as a laser or radiofrequency probe can be inserted. Using these instruments, the medial branch nerve can then be ablated under direct visualization. It is theorized that this procedure will allow more accurate targeting of this nerve and thus more predictable and lasting results than the more common blind medial branch rhizotomy. This procedure has been performed with great success at the Bone and Joint Clinic since 2009. The Spine Center is currently enrolling patients in a clinical study to collect comparative data on the effectiveness of this new technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Endoscopic Discectomy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this procedure, a small camera is inserted into a degenerated or herniated disc for the purpose of removing small fragments that are causing pain.Â  It is only indicated for specific types of disc lesions that are usually associated with a tear. During the procedure, a heat probe or laser is used to aid in sealing the torn disc and ablating loose tissue.Â  This is an outpatient procedure performed with the patient under sedation.Â  Patients are usually placed in a brace for several weeks following the procedure and allowed to return to most activities within two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Endoscopic Discectomy" border="0"

Using microscopic magnification and minimally invasive surgical techniques, a small rim of bone is shaved to allow access to the nerve and disc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the small incision the nerve is localized and gently retracted. This allows exposure of the disc herniation. This disc fragment is then easily removed with a special instrument. This removes the pressure and irritation from the nerve and as a result alleviates the sciatic pain. Patients typically go home several hours after the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interspinous Decompression (Aspen Device)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Microdiscectomy" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/microdiscectomy.png" style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px; margin: 0pt 20px 20px; width: 250px; height: 293px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; float: right;" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a low-risk surgical procedure used to indirectly decompress pinched nerves in the spine. The surgery is performed using a standard incision and exposure of the spinous processes (the raised bones you feel on your back). The space between two of these bones is expanded with special instrumentation and a spacer device is inserted and clamped into place. This allows the inflamed bony and soft tissues to relax and move away from the nerve structures in and around the spinal canal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients with lumbar stenosis who have primarily leg symptoms (pain, tingling, weakness) are generally good candidates for this procedure. Patients who have complete resolution of symptoms upon sitting or forced bending (such as leaning on a shopping cart) generally have excellent results with this low-risk surgery. One major advantage of this procedure is that it is usually performed in less than one hour and usually requires limited hospitalization â€“ even in patients with multiple medical problems.</p>\r\n', '2014-10-10 11:27:43');

This pain is usually worsened with standing and extension of your lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A facet injection is an injection of steroid into the facet joint of the spine. The steroid decreases inflammation in this joint and can relieve pain. Since steroid is used this procedure may provide relief anywhere from weeks to months and in some cases years. These injections can be repeated if needed for continued pain relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risks are rare but include infection, bleeding, prolonged increase in pain, and nerve damage. This procedure is done under X-ray guidance and IV sedation for your comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Epidural Steroid Injection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An epidural steroid injection (ESI) is an injection of long lasting steroid (â€œcortisoneâ€) in the epidural space; this space is the area which surrounds the spinal cord and the spinal nerves. The steroid medication injected reduces the inflammation and/or swelling of nerves in the epidural space, which may in turn reduce pain, tingling, numbness, and other symptoms. An ESI may be performed to relieve symptoms that are caused by spinal stenosis, spondylosis, or disc herniation. The procedure is done under IV sedation and with the guidance of an X-ray machine. The actual injection takes only a few minutes to perform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href="http://spinecenter.kmastage.com/education-resources/spine-articles/view/spinal-injections/">here</a> to read an article from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons about spinal injections.</p>\r\n', '2014-10-10 11:36:14');

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (129, 22, '<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">If you don''t see the answer to your question below,Â </span><a href="mailto:info@spinecenterbr.com" style="line-height: 1.6;">email us</a><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> and one of our helpful staff will get back with you.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a Physician Assistant and/or Nurse Practitioner, and can I see one when the doctor is out?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners are mid-level providers. They are licensed to evaluate patients independently, order diagnostic testing, diagnose, and establish treatment plans under the supervision of a collaborating physician. You may see a PA/NP without seeing the doctor, but the physician always reviews and approves any treatment protocols. PAâ€™s and NPâ€™s have prescriptive authority to prescribe and renew medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is it necessary to bring reports, previous X-rays and/or MRI films to my first appointment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all very important diagnostic tools and can be helpful for the physician to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can I tell if my child has scoliosis, and does it cause any problems?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at your childâ€™s spine to see if it curves. Also, check to see if one shoulder is lower than the other. Your doctor can also check by looking at your childâ€™s stance and ordering an X-ray for a definitive diagnosis. In most people, the curve in the spine is so small it causes no problems. In severe cases, the curve may cause back pain and restrict the amount of space available for the lungs and heart to work properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>If my spine is fused, will I have limitation in my motion?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of cases, patients are left with no significant decrease in motion. One and two level neck and back fusions rarely result in any limitation of â€œfunctionalâ€ motion. Some patients may notice a slight difference in full motion, but this usually does not affect most activities of daily living. Larger fusions involving three or more motion segments may result in a noticeable difference in some activities, but this is usually not debilitating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Will I need to wear a back or neck brace after my surgery and for how long?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This obviously differs with each of the types of surgeries we perform. For lower back fusions, patients typically stay in a stiff/rigid brace for six weeks, then transition into a softer brace for another four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For neck fusions, there is usually more variation in how long bracing is used. This ordinarily depends on how many levels are fused and the patientâ€™s bone quality. Most patients wear a stiff/rigid collar anywhere from two to six weeks, then a softer collar for another three to four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patientâ€™s undergoing non-fusion surgery, such as a microdiscectomy, typically wear a soft brace or corset brace for six weeks after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When can I return to work after my surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This varies significantly from patient to patient. We take into account the type of surgery performed, the patientâ€™s line of work, and their post-operative recovery when making this decision. In general, patients who perform sedentary work can return to work as soon as one to two weeks after surgery. Patients who perform heavy-demand work are generally out for a minimum of six weeks. Again, there is no one recommendation; therefore, we suggest you further discuss this during the surgical-planning phase of your care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When will I notice relief in my back or leg following an epidural steroid injection (ESI)?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most commonly, pain relief is noticed within 24 to 48 hours. Some patients respond slower and get results within 1 to 2 weeks. Maximum benefit is usually seen by 2 weeks post-procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How long will my ESI last?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is extremely variable from patient to patient. Some patients receive 1 or up to 3 injections with relief lasting from weeks to years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the risks and side effects associated with ESIâ€™s?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An ESI is one of the safest procedures performed in medicine today. The overall complication rate is far less than one percent. Nonetheless, there is some expectation of risk with any medical procedure. We take numerous precautions to prevent any problems and strongly recommend that all patients fully review their pre-injection instructions. Most complications arise from patients not following these instructions. The primary procedure risks involve bleeding, infection, spinal fluid leakage, and injury to nerve structures. Secondary risks involve the potential side effects of the medications used during the procedure (from the steroid itself). These include temporary weight gain, increase in blood sugar (mainly in diabetics), water retention, and suppression of the bodyâ€™s own natural production of similar steroids. Long-term effects of chronic steroid use include thinning of the bones, early cataract formation, and avascular necrosis (a condition involving decreased blood supply to the hip bone).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What should I do after my ESI? Can I return to work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise patients to take it easy for a day or so after the procedure. Afterward, patients are allowed to resume normal activities as tolerated. Most patients have no problem returning to work one or two days after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What should I expect to feel after an ESI?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the injection, some patients may feel a heaviness or numbness in the legs. This is an expected effect of the numbing agent and usually goes away after several hours. Most patients generally experience a â€œsore backâ€ for a day or two afterward. The full effect of the steroid medication usually takes 24 to 48 hours to begin working. Some patients have a longer period until they feel relief. It is not uncommon for many patients to feel relief for only a week or so after a first injection; this usually will result in long-term pain relief after a repeated injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the advantages of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) compared to traditional open surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures typically involve less destruction of normal tissues during surgery. In a traditional open procedure, a wide area of normal tissues (muscles, ligaments and bone structures) are sacrificed during the surgical exposure. These structures typically never return to normal function and will eventually form a large mass of scar that may later cause pain, spasm and dysfunction. During a minimally invasive surgery, special equipment and techniques are employed that allow for the same surgery to be performed with significantly less surgical morbidity. In addition, patients usually have less blood-loss, require shorter hospital stays and encounter less post-operative complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the advantages of endoscopic surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes referred to as â€˜laserâ€™ surgery, endoscopic spine surgery is a newer type of minimally invasive spine procedure offered today. During this type of surgery, a small camera is used. This allows for better and more accurate visualization of the areas being targeted. The major advantage of these procedures is that a very small area of normal tissue is disrupted during the surgery. As a result, most patients experience very little pain and have a minimal amount of blood-loss. In addition, this is almost always an outpatient procedure. We offer several different types of endoscopic procedures depending on the patients specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Will I need to go to Physical Therapy after my surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of surgeries we perform the only physical therapy needed is for transfers and progressive ambulation. In most cases, this is performed during a patients hospital stay and most people donâ€™t require additional visits with a therapist. Occasionally, some patients may require physical therapy via a home-health agency â€“ the decision for this is made at time of discharge. Following some lumbar procedures, some people benefit greatly from pool-therapy. This is usually evaluated and decided upon during post-operative office visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many patients overlook the role of physical therapy prior to surgery. This often occurs as some people may have had a negative experience with physical therapy in the past. Ideally, pre-operative physical therapy should be targeted to strengthen and condition muscles that support and surround the spine. The stronger these muscles are prior to surgery, the quicker they will rebound afterward. Conversely, weaker muscles will generally require more time and conditioning to return to normal function.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is facet pain?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Lumbar Facet Syndrome, facet pain refers to pain that is generated by the small joints that form the spinal column. These joints fall victim to degenerative changes (arthritis) in all humans. Many people are lucky and only experience minimal or no pain from this natural process. Other people can experience severe symptoms resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most patients note early morning low back pain that improves after they begin moving around. Pain sometimes returns after one has been idle for a while. This pain usually worsens with extension of the lumbar spine - when the spine is stretched and arched backwards (i.e. shoulders back). A Medial Branch Block or Facet Injection is a procedure that helps to diagnose this pain. Many patients with facet pain improve with medications, physical therapy and activity modification. Some patients may require injections and/or surgery depending on their level of disability. The Endoscopic Rhizotomy procedure is extremely effective in providing long-term pain relief from this problem.</p>\r\n', '2014-10-10 12:32:14');

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?Â </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System is used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse procedure. The iFuse implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;">5.

How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse procedure. The iFuse implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant.

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Implant System Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?Â </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse Implant System surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse Implant System implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implant System Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse Implant System implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant Systemis used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse Implant System implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse Implant System surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse Implant System surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse Implant System procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse Implant System procedure. The iFuse Implant System implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse Implant System can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both.

Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse Implant System surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse Implant System implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implant System Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse Implant System implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant Systemis used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse Implant System implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse Implant System surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse Implant System surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse Implant System procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse Implant System procedure. The iFuse Implant System implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse Implant System can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant System Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;">5.

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Implant System Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4.

Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?Â </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse Implant System surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse Implant System implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implant System Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse Implant System implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant Systemis used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse Implant System implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse Implant System surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse Implant System surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse Implant System procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse Implant System procedure. The iFuse Implant System implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse Implant System can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant System Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">5.

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Implant System Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.

It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Implant System Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?Â </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse Implant System surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse Implant System implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implant System Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse Implant System implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant Systemis used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse Implant System implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse Implant System surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse Implant System surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse Implant System procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse Implant System procedure. The iFuse Implant System implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse Implant System can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant System Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">5.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (142, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a â€œslipped discâ€ as a cause of low back pain. The word â€œsciaticaâ€ may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a â€œdiscâ€ or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms donâ€™t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?Â </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System is used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse procedure. The iFuse implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;">5.

The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System is used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctorâ€™s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctorâ€™s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeonâ€™s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse procedure. The iFuse implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Â </p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:10px;">5.

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (147, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/education-resources/spine-articles/view/minimally-invasive-vs-traditional-open-spine-surgery-explained/" target="_blank">here </a>to read an article about Minimally Invasive vs. Traditional Open Spine Surgey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treatment Options for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Treatments can vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and how much they limit your everyday activities. Below are some of the treatment options you may want to discuss with your doctor, depending on your symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nonsurgical Treatment for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">As a first line of treatment, your doctor may prescribe any one or more of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">\r\n	<li>Medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.</li>\r\n	<li>Physical therapy can help provide strengthening and pelvic stabilization exercises to reduce the movement in the SI joint.</li>\r\n	<li>SI belt wraps around the hips to help squeeze the sacroiliac joints together. This supports and stabilizes the pelvis and sacroiliac joints.</li>\r\n	<li>SI joint injections can reduce inflammation and relieve the pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">If symptoms persist due to instability, your physician may recommend <a

INSERT INTO `pageArchive` VALUES (148, 9, '<p><em>Minimally invasive fusion techniques are used to accomplish the same goals as open fusion surgery but with much smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, faster recovery, shorter hospital stays, less blood loss and less postoperative pain. There are several minimally invasive fusion techniques used at The Spine Center. Several are described below.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is insertedÂ  and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.Â  Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360Â° fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/education-resources/spine-articles/view/minimally-invasive-vs-traditional-open-spine-surgery-explained/" target="_blank">here </a>to read an article about Minimally Invasive vs. Traditional Open Spine Surgey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name="ifuse"></a>Treatment Options for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatments can vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and how much they limit your everyday activities. Below are some of the treatment options you may want to discuss with your doctor, depending on your symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nonsurgical Treatment for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first line of treatment, your doctor may prescribe any one or more of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help relieve pain and reduce inflammation.</li>\r\n	<li>Physical therapy can help provide strengthening and pelvic stabilization exercises to reduce the movement in the SI joint.</li>\r\n	<li>SI belt wraps around the hips to help squeeze the sacroiliac joints together. This supports and stabilizes the pelvis and sacroiliac joints.</li>\r\n	<li>SI joint injections can reduce inflammation and relieve the pain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If symptoms persist due to instability, your physician may recommendÂ <a href="/spine-procedures/ifuse-implant-system/">stabilizing your joint with sacroiliac joint fusion</a>.</p>\r\n', '2014-12-11 16:07:54');

As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed. During this process, bone spurs and disc material that is pressing on nerves and causing symptoms can be removed with special instruments. An implant is then placed where the disc once was to allow structural support and fusion. Screws are then placed through small poke incisions in the skin. This stabilizes the spine and supports the construct until the fusion can heal completely.</p>\r\n<a name="ifuse"></a>\r\n<p>Typically patients are discharged 1 to 3 days after the surgery. As compared with open surgery, significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stay can be avoided through these minimally invasive techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click <a href="http://spinecenterbr.com/education-resources/spine-articles/view/minimally-invasive-vs-traditional-open-spine-surgery-explained/" target="_blank">here </a>to read an article about Minimally Invasive vs. Traditional Open Spine Surgey.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treatment Options for Sacroiliac Joint Disorders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatments can vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and how much they limit your everyday activities.

Please see below for more information on our currently available studies. Forms in this section require <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank">Adobe Reader</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Frequently asked questions about Clinical Research</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a clinical research study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called a clinical trial, a clinical research study is a scientific study of a medical treatment.&nbsp; Research studies can evaluate new medical treatments, such as new drugs or procedures, or they can be used to learn more about the effectiveness of existing treatments. Data is collected before, during and after treatment to evaluate patients&rsquo; experiences and results. Once this data is analyzed, it can be published and shared with the clinical community. Clinical research results are very important for guiding and advancing clinical care. For studies involving investigational treatments, the results are used to gain FDA approval and ultimately reimbursement from insurance companies. For studies involving existing treatments, the results help guide physicians&rsquo; recommendations to patients and, with enough studies, establish standard of care treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What types of clinical research studies are being conducted at the Spine Center?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the studies we are conducting at the Spine Center are sponsored, multi-center, post-market device studies. This means we are evaluating surgical devices that are FDA approved and used by surgeons throughout the US. One type of post-market study seeks to determine if the device being studied is comparable or better than a similar device and surgical procedure. Patients in this type of study will be randomized to receive one of two comparable surgical devices. In another type of post-market study, all patients receive the same surgery. These studies evaluate efficacy based on patient improvement only. Both types of studies are used to advance the clinical knowledge of existing spine surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also involved in some in-house research. In-house studies are not sponsored; they are conducted to evaluate patient outcomes after surgery or other treatment at the Spine Center. These studies provide us with real results and statistics from our patient population that can be used in clinical decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All studies conducted at the Spine Center are approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. This is a central IRB that reviews and monitors research studies. They provide guidelines for research sites to follow and ensure the protection of all research participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is required of a patient in a research study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before a patient can be enrolled in a research study, he/she must sign an Informed Consent. This is a study specific consent form that the research staff will review with you. The Consent form is a great resource with patient oriented details about the study and all study procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a patient has consented to participate in a study, he/she will be asked to attend pre-operative and post-operative office visits (similar to standard care), get x-rays and/or MRIs, and fill out questionnaires about pain and function.&nbsp; All sponsored studies offer compensation for patients fully participating in study visits. Our current studies offer up to $600 if you complete all the study visits. The sponsor company will also pay for all study specific tests or treatments that are not covered by your insurance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why should I participate?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to financial compensation for study visits, patients involved in a research study at the Spine Center receive the same support, care and the same surgical options that they would outside of the study. The study staff is an added resource; we are available to address any questions or concerns and coordinate all study activities. We carefully monitor research participants before and after surgery.

The entire procedure is done through a small incision, with no soft tissue stripping and minimal tendon irritation. Patients may leave the hospital the next day after surgery and can usually resume daily living activities within six weeks, depending on how well they are healing and based on physician&rsquo;s orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse procedure offers several benefits compared to traditional sacroiliac joint surgery:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Minimal incision size</li>\r\n	<li>Immediate post-operative stabilization</li>\r\n	<li>Minimal soft tissue stripping</li>\r\n	<li>Potential of a quicker recovery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="action-btn" href="/spine-procedures/ifuse-implant-system/" title="iFuse Implant System">Learn More About The iFuse Implant System</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lateral Lumbar Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This surgical technique is done with the patient positioned on their side. Through a small incision (2cm) special dilators are used to dilate down to the side of the vertebrae. Special nerve monitoring is used to navigate these away from the small nerves that are bundled in this area over the spine. Once in a safe position, a retractor is inserted&nbsp; and the dilators are removed. Through this retractor, microscopic magnification is used to visualize the disc which is then removed. In place of the disc a special artificial spacer is placed with bone graft incoporated in its center. This allows distraction of the disc space that was previously collapsed and as a result indirectly opens the areas where the nerves were once compressed. In addition, this spacer provides structural support, corrects any scoliosis and allows fusion to occur in this area.&nbsp; Using this minimally invasive technique avoids any incision or disruption of the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the spacer has been inserted, the wound is closed and dressed and the patient is brought to the recovery area. Patients typically stay in the hospital one to two days. The video link below is a brief movie demonstrating the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Axial LIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Axial LIF procedure is a newly developed minimally invasive fusion technique that allows fusion of the lowest or the lower two levels of the low back through a tiny incision. This incision is placed at the base of the buttock far below the waist line. This is cosmetically advantageous and also allows us to avoid any incision on the sensitive muscles of the lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" alt="Axial LIF" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/axial-lif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt; width: 200px; height: 195px;" width="200" />Through a small 1 cm incision made at the base of the buttock, the space in front of the tailbone is entered. This region allows safer access to the front of the sacrum. A small hole is created in the sacrum that allows access to the disc space. Using special instruments and image guidance, work is done through this small hole to remove the disc and fuse the interbody area. Bone that was obtained from the small hole is used as the graft to allow the fusion. In addition, a special screw rod device is inserted to secure this area and distract the previously collapsed disc space. This indirectly opens the space where the nerves are exiting the spinal canal and as a result alleviates the pressure and pain created by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is complete the small incision closed and the patient is brought to recovery. Typically patients are discharged the next day. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/mycysi1WM7k?autostart=true" target="_blank">here</a> to see a short video about Axial LIF procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Percutaneous Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Percutaneous fusion is a procedure that is accomplished through several small pokes in the skin. A 360&deg; fusion can be obtained using special techniques and without the required incision and pain typical of an open fusion surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align="left" height="160" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/percutaneous-fusion.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 10px 0pt" />Through the small pokes in the skin the disc is entered and removed using special instruments and nerve monitoring. Once the disc is cleared out, a special graft containment device is inserted into the space through a small canula. This device is then packed slowly with bone through this canula. As it is packed the device and disc space expands until it completely fills the disc space. This allows an interbody fusion. Screws and additional bone graft are placed through additional small pokes in the skin. This allows stabilization and fusion over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients typically are discharged the following day. As a result of the minimally invasive nature of this procedure; significant blood loss, postoperative pain, and hospital stays are all avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimally Invasive TLIF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) is a surgery that has been used to decompress and fuse the lower back for many years. This surgery is still used commonly today and typically performed through an open approach. A minimally invasive TLIF accomplishes the same goals through a tiny incision. Special dilators and tubular retractors are used in combination with microscopic magnification to perform this surgery through the small incision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name="ifuse"></a><img align="left" src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/mi-tlif.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px 0pt;" />Through these small tubular retractors, the lumbar spine can be decompressed.

[/split/]Endoscopic Rhizotomy, Endoscopic Discectomy', '', '<h2>Endoscopic Rhizotomy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The facet joints of the lumbar spine are responsible for controlling motion and providing stability to the lower back. These small articulations can develop arthritis and inflammation similar to the hip, knee and other larger joints in the body. The facets are thought to be responsible for low back pain in up to 40% of cases. The facet joints are innervated by a small medial branch of the spinal nerve. This nerve is responsible for transmitting the sensation of pain from the facet back to the brain. In patients with suspected facet related pain, the medial branch has historically been targeted with a rhizotomy. This procedure has been classically done by pain management doctors. A probe is inserted percutaneously with X-ray guidance to the area where the nerve is thought to be located based on anatomic relationships. The probe is then heated and wanded back and forth with the hope of ablating the nerve and relieving the pain. However, this blind technique can have its limitations and failures, and recurrence rates can be high. When this procedure is successful, patients can experience relief of their lower back pain up to 12-18 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Endoscopic Rhizotomy" src="http://boneandjointclinicbr.com/newsletter/080712/images/rhizotomy-2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; float:right; margin: 0 0 15px 20px;" />The Spine Center at the Bone and Joint Clinic of Baton Rouge has been performing a new and innovative procedure for facet related back pain. Patients are diagnosed with this condition through a physical examination, radiographic studies and a confirmatory medial branch block injection. Appropriate patients are considered for the endoscopically assisted medial branch rhizotomy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this procedure, an endoscope is inserted percutaneously and the medial branch nerve is located with direct visualization. The endoscope has a unique working channel through which special instruments such as a laser or radiofrequency probe can be inserted. Using these instruments, the medial branch nerve can then be ablated under direct visualization. It is theorized that this procedure will allow more accurate targeting of this nerve and thus more predictable and lasting results than the more common blind medial branch rhizotomy. This procedure has been performed with great success at the Bone and Joint Clinic since 2009. The Spine Center is currently enrolling patients in a clinical study to collect comparative data on the effectiveness of this new technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Endoscopic Discectomy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this procedure, a small camera is inserted into a degenerated or herniated disc for the purpose of removing small fragments that are causing pain.&nbsp; It is only indicated for specific types of disc lesions that are usually associated with a tear. During the procedure, a heat probe or laser is used to aid in sealing the torn disc and ablating loose tissue.&nbsp; This is an outpatient procedure performed with the patient under sedation.&nbsp; Patients are usually placed in a brace for several weeks following the procedure and allowed to return to most activities within two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Endoscopic Discectomy" border="0"

They are licensed to evaluate patients independently, order diagnostic testing, diagnose, and establish treatment plans under the supervision of a collaborating physician. You may see a PA/NP without seeing the doctor, but the physician always reviews and approves any treatment protocols. PA&rsquo;s and NP&rsquo;s have prescriptive authority to prescribe and renew medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is it necessary to bring reports, previous X-rays and/or MRI films to my first appointment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These are all very important diagnostic tools and can be helpful for the physician to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can I tell if my child has scoliosis, and does it cause any problems?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Look at your child&rsquo;s spine to see if it curves. Also, check to see if one shoulder is lower than the other. Your doctor can also check by looking at your child&rsquo;s stance and ordering an X-ray for a definitive diagnosis. In most people, the curve in the spine is so small it causes no problems. In severe cases, the curve may cause back pain and restrict the amount of space available for the lungs and heart to work properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>If my spine is fused, will I have limitation in my motion?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of cases, patients are left with no significant decrease in motion. One and two level neck and back fusions rarely result in any limitation of &ldquo;functional&rdquo; motion. Some patients may notice a slight difference in full motion, but this usually does not affect most activities of daily living. Larger fusions involving three or more motion segments may result in a noticeable difference in some activities, but this is usually not debilitating.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Will I need to wear a back or neck brace after my surgery and for how long?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This obviously differs with each of the types of surgeries we perform. For lower back fusions, patients typically stay in a stiff/rigid brace for six weeks, then transition into a softer brace for another four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For neck fusions, there is usually more variation in how long bracing is used. This ordinarily depends on how many levels are fused and the patient&rsquo;s bone quality. Most patients wear a stiff/rigid collar anywhere from two to six weeks, then a softer collar for another three to four weeks thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patient&rsquo;s undergoing non-fusion surgery, such as a microdiscectomy, typically wear a soft brace or corset brace for six weeks after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When can I return to work after my surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This varies significantly from patient to patient. We take into account the type of surgery performed, the patient&rsquo;s line of work, and their post-operative recovery when making this decision. In general, patients who perform sedentary work can return to work as soon as one to two weeks after surgery. Patients who perform heavy-demand work are generally out for a minimum of six weeks. Again, there is no one recommendation; therefore, we suggest you further discuss this during the surgical-planning phase of your care.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When will I notice relief in my back or leg following an epidural steroid injection (ESI)?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most commonly, pain relief is noticed within 24 to 48 hours. Some patients respond slower and get results within 1 to 2 weeks. Maximum benefit is usually seen by 2 weeks post-procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How long will my ESI last?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is extremely variable from patient to patient. Some patients receive 1 or up to 3 injections with relief lasting from weeks to years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the risks and side effects associated with ESI&rsquo;s?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An ESI is one of the safest procedures performed in medicine today. The overall complication rate is far less than one percent. Nonetheless, there is some expectation of risk with any medical procedure. We take numerous precautions to prevent any problems and strongly recommend that all patients fully review their pre-injection instructions. Most complications arise from patients not following these instructions. The primary procedure risks involve bleeding, infection, spinal fluid leakage, and injury to nerve structures. Secondary risks involve the potential side effects of the medications used during the procedure (from the steroid itself). These include temporary weight gain, increase in blood sugar (mainly in diabetics), water retention, and suppression of the body&rsquo;s own natural production of similar steroids. Long-term effects of chronic steroid use include thinning of the bones, early cataract formation, and avascular necrosis (a condition involving decreased blood supply to the hip bone).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What should I do after my ESI? Can I return to work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We advise patients to take it easy for a day or so after the procedure. Afterward, patients are allowed to resume normal activities as tolerated. Most patients have no problem returning to work one or two days after the procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What should I expect to feel after an ESI?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after the injection, some patients may feel a heaviness or numbness in the legs. This is an expected effect of the numbing agent and usually goes away after several hours. Most patients generally experience a &ldquo;sore back&rdquo; for a day or two afterward. The full effect of the steroid medication usually takes 24 to 48 hours to begin working. Some patients have a longer period until they feel relief. It is not uncommon for many patients to feel relief for only a week or so after a first injection; this usually will result in long-term pain relief after a repeated injection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the advantages of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) compared to traditional open surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimally invasive procedures typically involve less destruction of normal tissues during surgery. In a traditional open procedure, a wide area of normal tissues (muscles, ligaments and bone structures) are sacrificed during the surgical exposure. These structures typically never return to normal function and will eventually form a large mass of scar that may later cause pain, spasm and dysfunction. During a minimally invasive surgery, special equipment and techniques are employed that allow for the same surgery to be performed with significantly less surgical morbidity. In addition, patients usually have less blood-loss, require shorter hospital stays and encounter less post-operative complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the advantages of endoscopic surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes referred to as &lsquo;laser&rsquo; surgery, endoscopic spine surgery is a newer type of minimally invasive spine procedure offered today. During this type of surgery, a small camera is used. This allows for better and more accurate visualization of the areas being targeted. The major advantage of these procedures is that a very small area of normal tissue is disrupted during the surgery. As a result, most patients experience very little pain and have a minimal amount of blood-loss. In addition, this is almost always an outpatient procedure. We offer several different types of endoscopic procedures depending on the patients specific problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Will I need to go to Physical Therapy after my surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the majority of surgeries we perform the only physical therapy needed is for transfers and progressive ambulation. In most cases, this is performed during a patients hospital stay and most people don&rsquo;t require additional visits with a therapist. Occasionally, some patients may require physical therapy via a home-health agency &ndash; the decision for this is made at time of discharge. Following some lumbar procedures, some people benefit greatly from pool-therapy. This is usually evaluated and decided upon during post-operative office visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many patients overlook the role of physical therapy prior to surgery. This often occurs as some people may have had a negative experience with physical therapy in the past. Ideally, pre-operative physical therapy should be targeted to strengthen and condition muscles that support and surround the spine. The stronger these muscles are prior to surgery, the quicker they will rebound afterward. Conversely, weaker muscles will generally require more time and conditioning to return to normal function.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is facet pain?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Also known as Lumbar Facet Syndrome, facet pain refers to pain that is generated by the small joints that form the spinal column. These joints fall victim to degenerative changes (arthritis) in all humans. Many people are lucky and only experience minimal or no pain from this natural process. Other people can experience severe symptoms resulting in varying degrees of disability. Most patients note early morning low back pain that improves after they begin moving around. Pain sometimes returns after one has been idle for a while. This pain usually worsens with extension of the lumbar spine - when the spine is stretched and arched backwards (i.e. shoulders back). A Medial Branch Block or Facet Injection is a procedure that helps to diagnose this pain. Many patients with facet pain improve with medications, physical therapy and activity modification. Some patients may require injections and/or surgery depending on their level of disability. The Endoscopic Rhizotomy procedure is extremely effective in providing long-term pain relief from this problem.</p>\r\n', 1, 1, NULL, 0, '', 270, '2014-12-11 13:41:18', '');

The disc has a softer center surrounded by a stronger exterior.&nbsp; A herniated disc refers to a problem with your disc where the softer center pushes out through the stronger exterior and can cause pressure or irritation of the nearby nerves.&nbsp; This irritation can result in pain, numbness, tingling and or weakness in the legs. Sometimes a herniated disc causes no symptoms.&nbsp; If you do have symptoms that affect your quality of life then treatment options are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lumbar Radiculopathy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/lumbar-radiculopathy.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px; width: 91px; height: 145px; float: right;" />Lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica refers to pain that radiates from your back down one or both legs. This pain travels down the path of the sciatic nerve or its branches. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and supplies function to the legs. The pain associated with sciatica is related to compression or irritation of one or more nerves from your lower back. This is usually the result of another problem, for example a herniated disc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Degenerative Disc Disease / Spondolysis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Degenerative&nbsp;disc&nbsp;disease refers to the normal aging process to the&nbsp;disc&nbsp;or spine.&nbsp; Your&nbsp;disc&nbsp;is normally fluid filled in the center and over a period of time this&nbsp;disc&nbsp;will become dehydrated.&nbsp; These changes may or may not cause symptoms.&nbsp; If you have pain related to a degenerative&nbsp;disc&nbsp;it usually causes lower back pain that can&nbsp; range from mild to severe.&nbsp; Even though you may have changes seen by&nbsp;xray&nbsp;or MRI it doesn&rsquo;t mean you will have pain or that the pain will be permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spondylosis&nbsp;is the normal aging process to the bones in the spine.&nbsp; Another term for&nbsp;spondylosis&nbsp;is osteoarthritis of the spine.&nbsp; It affects the spinal bones and joints rather than the&nbsp;discs&nbsp;of the spine.&nbsp; It also can cause lower back pain that can range from mild to severe.&nbsp; Treatment options depend on the severity of the symptoms associated with the arthritis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Degenerative&nbsp;Disc&nbsp;Disease and&nbsp;spondylosis&nbsp;are both considered to be normal wear and tear changes to the spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lumbar&nbsp;Stenosis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="http://spinecenterbr.com/images/uploads/Capture._SS.PNG" style="margin: 0pt 20px 20px; width: 200px; height: 145px; float: right;" />Lumbar or spinal&nbsp;stenosis&nbsp;is a narrowing of the canal where your nerves are held in your lower back.&nbsp; This narrowing is usually a result of&nbsp;disc&nbsp;bulging and&nbsp;spondylosis&nbsp;(osteoarthritis) of the spinal joints.&nbsp; If the nerves are compressed this can cause nerve pain shooting into the legs.&nbsp; This pain can be associated with numbness, tingling, weakness, and rarely bowel and bladder dysfunction.&nbsp; The pain is usually worse with walking and can get better with leaning forward and sitting down.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cervical Disc Herniation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A cervical disc is a round, flat&nbsp; cushion between each of the verterbrae (bones) in the spine.&nbsp; They act as shock absorbers for the&nbsp; spine.&nbsp; A disc that bulges out of place&nbsp; or breaks open is a bulging or herniated disc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cervical Radiculopathy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Damage or irritation to one or more of the nerves exiting off the spinal&nbsp; cord resulting in symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling, and/or weakness in a&nbsp; shoulder or arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cervical Stenosis/Myelopathy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervical stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal&nbsp; canal. This is normally a slow, gradual process.&nbsp; This can lead to narrowing or squeezing of&nbsp; the nerves exiting the spinal cord or actually irritate or press on the spinal&nbsp; cord itself.&nbsp; Cervical myelopathy is a&nbsp; compression of the spinal cord resulting from stenosis.&nbsp; Symptoms of myelopathy can include heavy&nbsp; feeling in the legs, gait or balance disturbance, clumsy hands, decrease in&nbsp; fine motor skills, and bladder or bowel dysfunction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Idiopathic Scoliosis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Scoliosis refers to a lateral&nbsp; curvature of the spine.&nbsp; Idiopathic&nbsp; scoliosis is of unknown cause and may be related to a family history of&nbsp; scoliosis.&nbsp; Adolescent Idiopathic&nbsp; Scoliosis is the more common form and is found between the ages of 10 and 19.&nbsp; It is more common in girls than boys.&nbsp; It can be progressive and it is important&nbsp; that the curvature be monitored by a physician.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Adult Scoliosis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine) found in individuals greater&nbsp; than 19 years of age.&nbsp; Causes include&nbsp; idiopathic scoliosis missed in childhood which progressed and became&nbsp; symptomactic or other conditions including degenerative disc disease,&nbsp; congenital abnormalities, trauma or fractures, and neuro-muscular diseases&nbsp; (post-polio syndrome, muscular dystrophy, etc).</p>\r\n', 1, 1, NULL, 0, '', 180, '2014-12-11 13:41:18', '');

As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>iFuse Implant System Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. What are some causes for pain in the lower back, buttocks or pelvic region? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low back pain is a common symptom that affects many people during their lifetime. For some, low back pain can be an acute, shortterm problem. Others experience chronic, long-term symptoms. There are many structures in the lower back and pelvic area that can cause pain. Most commonly, people think of a &ldquo;slipped disc&rdquo; as a cause of low back pain. The word &ldquo;sciatica&rdquo; may be used when describing low back pain. Occasionally, hip problems can be confused with low back conditions. In fact, there are many causes of back pain, including arthritis of the back, osteoporosis, and a poorly aligned spine. The SI joint can be a significant contributor to pain in the lower back, pelvic region, buttocks, or legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Where is my SI joint? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is located in the pelvis, linking the iliac bone (pelvis) to the sacrum (lowest part of the spine above the tailbone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. How does my SI joint work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The function of the SI joint is to transfer weight and forces due to movement from your upper body through the pelvis to your legs and vice versa. The SI joint is an essential component for shock absorption to prevent impact forces during walking from reaching the spine. The primary role of the sacroiliac joint is to provide stability for the pelvis and to bear the load of the upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Why does the SI joint start having problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the motion in your pelvis is asymmetric, then problems can occur in your SI joint. You could have asymmetric motion if your legs are significantly different in length. This can be congenital or caused due to an injury or illness such as polio or scoliosis. Other conditions that can predispose you to SI joint problems include having one leg that is weaker, such as seen with hip osteoarthritis. These biomechanical conditions, or even wearing inappropriate footwear, can alter your gait and cause repetitive stress to your sacroiliac joint and related structures. Other potential causes of SI joint problems include joint disruptions, degenerative sacroiliitis, history of trauma, pregnancy/ childbirth, and other unknown reasons. Injury from accidents is another predisposing factor for SI joint pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. How does the SI joint cause pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SI joint is a synovial joint. This type of joint has free nerve endings that can cause chronic pain if the joint degenerates or does not move properly. The SI joint has been long known to cause pain in the lower back and buttocks. Like any other joint in the body, the SI joint can become arthritic or its support ligaments can become loose or injured. When this happens, people can feel pain in their back, especially with lifting, running or even walking. In these cases, the pain is sometimes similar to the pain caused by a &ldquo;disc&rdquo; or spinal arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. How common are SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is commonly reported in clinical literature that up to 25% of all low back pain is caused by the SI joint. Risk factors associated with lower back pain may include, smoking, poor physical condition, positive family history, and occupational lifting.<sup>5,6,7 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. How is low back pain due to the SI joint manifested? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people have pain that worsens over time. However, over half the time SI joint pain can be related to a specific event, often an injury. It is difficult to directly relate any specific functioning difficulty (including walking, sitting, standing, sleeping on the affected side, job activity, bowel movements, cough, sneeze, etc.) to the sacroiliac joint as a source of pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Who is at risk for SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women may be at increased risk for SI joint problems because of their broader pelvises, the greater curve of their necks, and shorter limb lengths. In addition, pregnancy often leads to stretching of the pelvis, specifically in the sacroiliac ligaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. How would I know that my SI joint is not functioning properly? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have trouble sleeping comfortably, or frequently experience your leg giving way, pain in certain lying or bending positions, or tenderness in your buttocks, you may have an SI joint disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Will my doctor check for SI problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors do not always look for the SI joint as a source of lower back pain, although many articles have been written about it. Sometimes your lower back pain may have been previously diagnosed as originating from the lumbar spine. However, if your symptoms don&rsquo;t fit what the doctor can see on an MRI, this may indicate that your pain is coming from a place other than the lumbar spinal region. Your doctor may determine if your SI joint is the source of your pain by ruling out other sources of pain as well as running specific tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What should I tell my doctor about my back or buttock pain? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important information you can give your doctor is the exact location of your pain. Try to notice when the pain occurs and how intensely you feel it in various locations, including your low back, buttocks, and legs. Also, be sure to tell your doctor about any previous injury that may have either directly affected your pelvis, or caused you to walk asymmetrically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. How will my doctor determine whether I have SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will consider all the information you provide, including any history of injury, location of your pain, and problems standing or sleeping. Your doctor will also give you a physical examination. You may be asked to stand or move in different positions and point to where you feel pain. Your doctor may manipulate your joints or feel for tenderness over your SI joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosis of SI joint disorders. It is also important to remember that more than one condition (like a disc or hip problem) can coexist with SI joint problems and your doctor will need to check for other factors that may be causing your pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most widely used method to determine the cause of SI joint pain is to inject the SI joint with a painkiller. Your doctor will deliver the injection with either fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance to ensure that the needle is accurately placed in the SI joint. If, following the injection, your pain is decreased by more than 75%, then it can be concluded that the SI joint is either the source or a major contributor to your low back pain. If the level of pain does not change after the injection, it is unlikely that the SI joint is the cause of your low back pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How easy is it to diagnose SI joint problems? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not always easy to diagnose SI joint disorders, but provocative tests and injections are helpful for confirming the SI joint as the pain source. Sometimes your physical findings may indicate a SI joint condition, but chronic changes may also be seen in your lumbar spine. Your doctor may discuss the difficulty of making a correct diagnosis in the presence of multiple problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1<span style="line-height: 1.6;">4. What are some options for treatment of SI problems?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several options for treating SI joint problems. Some people respond to physical therapy, chiropractic manipulations, and exercises. Others require more interventional treatments including various oral medications, or therapeutic injections. These treatments are performed repetitively, and frequently symptom improvement using these therapies is temporary. Once non-surgical treatment options have been tried and do not provide relief, your surgeon may consider other options, including surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacroiliac joint fusion, is a surgical procedure intended to stabilize the joint and eliminate motion. SI joint fusion can relieve pain in many cases.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How will my doctor determine whether I am a candidate for the iFuse Implant System Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the source of your low back pain has been diagnosed as SI joint in origin, your surgeon will discuss the iFuse Implant System Implant System procedure as a potential treatment option. You may be an iFuse Implant System surgical candidate if your low back symptoms are predominantly below your L5 vertebra, your doctor does not find any neurological problems, and is able to determine through maneuvering your joint that your pain originates in the SI joint. To confirm your diagnosis, your doctor may administer a CT guided injection of pain reducing medication to your SI joint and verify that you experience significant pain relief from it. Some doctors may repeat the injection to be sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. What are iFuse Implant System implants made of? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants are small titanium rods about the size of your little finger. Titanium is a very strong but lightweight material, commonly used for medical device implants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do the iFuse Implant System Implants work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System implants have triangular crosssections to keep them from rotating once they have been implanted. They are also coated with a titanium plasma spray that creates a rough surface to better secure the iFuse Implant System implants to bone. The stiffness of the implants holds the joint in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is the procedure for iFuse Implant System? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant Systemis used in a surgical procedure that is performed in an operating room with either general or spinal anesthesia. You will be lying face down while your surgeon uses the specially designed system to guide the instruments that prepare the bone and insert the implants. The surgical technique, iFuse Implant System implant, and supporting instrumentation are designed to offer maximum protection to your tissues during the surgical procedure. The entire procedure is performed through a small incision (approximately 2-3cm long), along the side of your buttock. During the procedure, X-ray guidance provides your surgeon with live imaging to facilitate proper placement of the implants. Typically three implants are placed, depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What happens after my iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide recommendations. These may include post-operatively using crutches, a cane or a walker for 3 to 6 weeks, depending upon what your doctor recommends. You should not travel by air for a minimum of 2 weeks after an iFuse Implant System surgery. This limitation on air travel is strictly a precaution, and has to do with decreasing what is already a low risk of clots forming in the veins of your legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At discharge, your doctor may arrange followup visits to assess the incision and take followup X-rays. It is recommended that you see your surgeon for a post-operative visit between 1 and 2 weeks following surgery. However each surgeon may have specific recommendations as patient situations may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based upon your doctor&rsquo;s recommendation, you will need to come back at or around 12 weeks for more X-rays and, barring any complications and your doctor&rsquo;s ok, you may resume full weight-bearing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. What can I do to avoid problems healing after iFuse Implant System surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will provide you with post-operative instructions. In general, you should avoid strenuous activities in the first six weeks and follow your surgeon&rsquo;s post-operative weight bearing and activity instructions. Avoid smoking, which is thought to impair bone fusion. Discuss your current medications with your surgeon; some medications may impair bone growth (for example: steroids). If you have osteoporosis, ask your doctor what osteoporosis medications might be best for your bone health.<sup>9,10 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. How soon can I resume my normal daily activities? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will advise you on resuming your daily living activities as your healing and symptoms allow. Depending on your occupation, you may be able to return to work at this time. You will need to have additional X-rays taken at 6 months and later at 1 year to assess your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. If I have an iFuse Implant System procedure, does it affect my ability to have other surgeries if I need them? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, a person may require other surgeries after having an iFuse Implant System procedure. The iFuse Implant System implants are not anticipated to affect the ability to have other surgeries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23. If I have already had one or more spinal surgeries, does this affect my ability to have an MIS SI joint surgery? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iFuse Implant System may be used in patients with previous orthopedic surgeries and spinal implants. SI joint problems may coexist with lumbar spine or hip conditions. SI joint problems may appear after lumbar spine surgery or hip replacements. The iFuse Implant System can be safely used after either lumber or hip surgeries or both. Your doctor will determine whether your health, including any impact from previous surgeries, influences your being a candidate for MIS sacroiliac joint fusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>24. Could there be complications from the iFuse Implant System procedure? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all surgical procedures and permanent implants, there are risks and considerations associated with surgery and use of the iFuse Implant System Implant. You should discuss these risks and considerations with your physician before deciding if this treatment option is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 10px;">5.
